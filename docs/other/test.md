<font color="olive" size="6">
I open my eyes. It is difficult to breathe here. I feel my neck tighten, the muscles hurting as if strangled. I take my hand to feel it, only to find the twisted roughness of‚Ä¶ a rope. <i>‚ÄúMother, what have I done?‚Äù</i> I gasp for air as I realize the source of the weight on my neck. Something snakes next to me, and I feel the tail of that constrictor material macabre waving in tune with my body. I can't remember how I go here. In fact, I can‚Äôt remember much as if I was just born, no past, no memories‚Ä¶ And yet, here I was lost in this city that felt somehow familiar. <i>‚ÄúHow did I get here? Am I dead?‚Äù</i> I grab the loose rope strongly. There is something familiar about this place, a lost memory fragment, a smell that I can almost feel. <i>‚ÄúHave I been here before?‚Äù</i> A flash of a grand party, a masquerade and the depths of horror‚Ä¶  
<br><br>
My chest pounds, pulsing uncontrollably as I realise am fleeing a tenacious citrine fog and the relentless threat I inexplicably know lurks within. I lay ragged and underprepared, surrounded by the sickly wall of yellow fog, knowing that‚Ä¶ no, feeling that, something is hunting me, something I know I cannot face. The fog slowly tumbles through the alley‚Äôs canyon of crumbling, grey brick walls like some jaundiced flash flood flowing in slow-motion. Ahead, an unfamiliar alley splits, curving to the left and right. Behind, from the silent swell of mist, emanates the sound of footsteps‚Äîslow, but somehow keeping pace with the careening, hungry wave. Through the thinner parts of the fog I start to see shadowy shapes of other people, all looking as confused by their situation as me‚Ä¶
<br><br>
Their voices rise above the opaque fog. Lost, afraid, they try to figure what is going on.  One shadow looks around spinning in a wide circle, running her fingers along the grey bricks, trying to find a way to run from the moving fog. <i>"Hide... don't let it find you..."</i> one nearby voice suggests. I look in its direction and see another shade stumbling in confusion, desperately looking for any open door or window in the crumbling walls. Look for anywhere that can shelter it the ominous mist. <i>"What is out there in the fog? I just know something is in the fog, something dangerous.‚Äù</i> The first shadowy figure claims, as both run vanishing from my view, looking for a place to hide. As one shadow disappears, another comes out of the mist. <i>"H-Hello? Wh-Who are you? Who... am I? Where is... this place?"</i> a younger voice this time. Confused and disoriented. This girl slowly turns the corner of a building. 
<br><br>
Who are these shadows? Can they be trusted?  I walk uncertainly into the mist, scanning the fog, trying to follow the voices, the only signs of life in this forsaken, yet so familiar, city. Why does it seem familiar? What is that thought just beyond my grasp, that clue that will help me piece it all together? I look at the rope around my neck once more and decide to remove it. I just can't remember how I got here as something were stopping me from remembering.  
<br><br>
I find them again. More and more of them. Six, seven, maybe eight shadows banding together in their confusion. I sense something passing me. A brief flow in the fog, a ghostly wind. A dangerous lust for blood. As the shadowy shapes turn into a smaller road, the alley walls sag, battered brick slumping over the path, nearly blotting out the bruised twilight sky. Again, they are confronted with a grimy cobblestone path splitting into one route uphill and another recklessly descending into the yellow sea. They stop, frustrated and lost. Is there a way out of this maze?

<font color="olive" size="6">Behind, the yellow fog and the relentless sound of pursuit grow closer. And the strange fear hanging on the heavy air becomes a reality. Gruesome sounds echo from all the alleys and wall. The screams of pain slowly go silent as blood spatters across the wall in front of me. I stop, breathless, looking around for the source of the blood, for the hunter in the mist when a brutally distorted corpse, half meat, half blood, drops at my feet. The city goes silent once again‚Ä¶
