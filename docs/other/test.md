<font color="black"><b>The evil that lies within:</b></font><font color="olive"><i>
You are lost in a city. You can't remember how or when you arrived at this place. It's as if you were just created here, no past, no memories and yet, as you look around, you seem to faintly recognise it. There is something familiar about this place, a lost memory fragment you try to cling on to, but never retrieve. Have you been here before? Your pulse pounds as, ragged and underprepared, you realise you are fleeing a tenacious citrine fog and the relentless threat you inexplicably know lurks within. Something is hunting you, something you know you cannot face.

You suddenly stop as you realise that all around is a wall of that sickly yellow fog, tumbling through the alley‚Äôs canyon of crumbling, grey brick walls like some jaundiced flash flood. Ahead, an unfamiliar alley splits, curving to the left and right. Behind, from the silent swell of mist, emanates the sound of footsteps‚Äîslow, but somehow keeping pace with the careening, hungry wave. You notice shadowy shapes of other people through the thinner parts of the fog. You can tell they are as confused as you are.

<font color="green"><b>Emerald Escallera:</b></font><br>
  <b>"Wha ? Where ?"</b> Looks around spinning in a wide circle. Touching the walls running her fingers along them. She tries to keep away from the boiling moving fog.<br>

<font color="blue"><b>Thelonious:</b></font><br>
I stumble in confusion looking around for any open door or window in the crumbling walls. Anywhere where I can find shelter from this ominous mist... <b>"Hide... don't let it find you..."</b>

  <b>"Who, who are you ? What is out there in the fog ?"</b> Emerald looks for someplace to hide and also picks out the left turn if she needs to run.<br>

<b>"Hide... we must hide from the fog"</b> I answer confusedly, prodding the walls like a blind man.<br>

Lars will retreat from the fog, backing up towards a wall he will quietly call out to the shadowy figures near him <b>"Hey friends. Who are you and where are we?"</b><br>

Confused and disoriented, the girl looks around. her heart pounding. <b>"H-Hello? Wh-Who are you? Who...am I? Where is...this place?"</b><br>
<br>

<b>‚ÄùI am...am... It doesn‚Äôt matter. Do you know what is in the fog. What is hunting us.‚Äù</b>
Lars will raise his voice, calling to the other shadows
<b>‚ÄùHello, you there! We must Band together so we can face the hunter as a group. Who knows what it is?‚Äù</b>

Lars will try to pick out the matching shadow to the voice and follow, scanning the fog around himself as he moves for any sign of danger.<br>

<font color="lime"><b>Nyssa:</b></font><br>
Nyssa is uncertain who she can trust in this misty, shadowy place that defies her memories. She silently follows the voices, the only signs of human life in this forsaken city. Why does it seem familiar? What is that thought just beyond her ability to grasp, that clue that will help her piece it all together? She can't remember details. It's as if... something were stopping her from remembering.

She continues to follow the voices. They sound just as lost and confused as she, but they could just be part of the mystery as well. She'll observe from the shadows, see where these people head and follow them. Perhaps the voice is correct and banding together is the answer. She will watch and see, and if it seems safe, she may reveal herself to them.

<font color="black"><b>The evil that lies within:</b></font><font color="olive"><i>
As you all try to find your footing in this misty place, you notice others and slowly join them, one by one. All except for Nyssa, who decides to stay behind, lurking as a shadow just outside reach. As Emerald confusedly turns left, the alley walls sag, battered brick slumping over the path, nearly blotting out the bruised twilight sky. Again the grimy cobblestone path splits. This time one route curves uphill, while the other recklessly descends.

Behind, where Nyssa stands, the yellow fog and the relentless sound of pursuit grow closer. As you stop to think, gruesome sounds echo around you as the screams of pain from one of the shadowy shapes, you previously noticed in the fog go silent. Blood spatters across the wall in front of you and a brutally distorted corpse, half meat, half blood, drops at your feet. You can't recognise him, or her, but somehow, you feel it was one of you.
