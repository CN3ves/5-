I open my eyes. It is difficult to breathe here. I feel my neck tighten, the muscles hurting as if strangled. I take my hand to feel it, only to find the twisted roughness of… a rope. <i>“Mother, what have I done?”</i> I gasp for air as I realize the source of the weight on my neck. Something snakes next to me, and I feel the tail of that constrictor material macabre waving in tune with my body. I can't remember how I go here. In fact, I can’t remember much as if I was just born, no past, no memories… And yet, here I was lost in this city that felt somehow familiar. <i>“How did I get here? Am I dead?”</i> I grab the loose rope strongly. There is something familiar about this place, a lost memory fragment, a smell that I can almost feel. <i>“Have I been here before?”</i> A flash of a grand party, a masquerade and the depths of horror…
