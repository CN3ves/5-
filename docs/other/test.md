I open my eyes. It is difficult to breathe here. I feel my neck tighten, the muscles hurting as if strangled. I take my hand to feel it, only to find the twisted roughness of… a rope. <i>“Mother, what have I done?”</i> I gasp for air as I realize the source of the weight on my neck. Something snakes next to me, and I feel the tail of that constrictor material macabre waving in tune with my body. I can't remember how I go here. In fact, I can’t remember much as if I was just born, no past, no memories… And yet, here I was lost in this city that felt somehow familiar. <i>“How did I get here? Am I dead?”</i> I grab the loose rope strongly. There is something familiar about this place, a lost memory fragment, a smell that I can almost feel. <i>“Have I been here before?”</i> A flash of a grand party, a masquerade and the depths of horror…

My chest pounds, pulsing uncontrollably as I realise am fleeing a tenacious citrine fog and the relentless threat I inexplicably know lurks within. I lay ragged and underprepared, surrounded by the sickly wall of yellow fog, knowing that… no, feeling that, something is hunting me, something I know I cannot face. The fog slowly tumbles through the alley’s canyon of crumbling, grey brick walls like some jaundiced flash flood flowing in slow-motion. Ahead, an unfamiliar alley splits, curving to the left and right. Behind, from the silent swell of mist, emanates the sound of footsteps—slow, but somehow keeping pace with the careening, hungry wave. Through the thinner parts of the fog I start to see shadowy shapes of other people, all looking as confused by their situation as me…
