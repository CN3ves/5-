<b>The evil that lies within:</b>
<font color="olive"><i>
You are lost in a city. You can't remember how or when you arrived at this place. It's as if you were just created here, no past, no memories and yet, as you look around, you seem to faintly recognise it. There is something familiar about this place, a lost memory fragment you try to cling on to, but never retrieve. Have you been here before? Your pulse pounds as, ragged and underprepared, you realise you are fleeing a tenacious citrine fog and the relentless threat you inexplicably know lurks within. Something is hunting you, something you know you cannot face.

You suddenly stop as you realise that all around is a wall of that sickly yellow fog, tumbling through the alley’s canyon of crumbling, grey brick walls like some jaundiced flash flood. Ahead, an unfamiliar alley splits, curving to the left and right. Behind, from the silent swell of mist, emanates the sound of footsteps—slow, but somehow keeping pace with the careening, hungry wave. You notice shadowy shapes of other people through the thinner parts of the fog. You can tell they are as confused as you are.
