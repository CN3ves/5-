<font color="black"><b>The evil that lies within:</b></font><font color="olive"><i>
You are lost in a city. You can't remember how or when you arrived at this place. It's as if you were just created here, no past, no memories and yet, as you look around, you seem to faintly recognise it. There is something familiar about this place, a lost memory fragment you try to cling on to, but never retrieve. Have you been here before? Your pulse pounds as, ragged and underprepared, you realise you are fleeing a tenacious citrine fog and the relentless threat you inexplicably know lurks within. Something is hunting you, something you know you cannot face.

You suddenly stop as you realise that all around is a wall of that sickly yellow fog, tumbling through the alley’s canyon of crumbling, grey brick walls like some jaundiced flash flood. Ahead, an unfamiliar alley splits, curving to the left and right. Behind, from the silent swell of mist, emanates the sound of footsteps—slow, but somehow keeping pace with the careening, hungry wave. You notice shadowy shapes of other people through the thinner parts of the fog. You can tell they are as confused as you are.

  <b>"Wha ? Where ?"</b> <br>
  Looks around spinning in a wide circle. Touching the walls running her fingers along them.
She tries to keep away from the boiling moving fog.

<font color="blue"><b>Thelonious:</b></font>
I stumble in confusion looking around for any open door or window in the crumbling walls. Anywhere where I can find shelter from this ominous mist...
<br>
<b>"Hide... don't let it find you..."</b>

  <b>"Who, who are you ? What is out there in the fog ?"</b> Emerald looks for someplace to hide and also picks out the left turn if she needs to run.

<b>"Hide... we must hide from the fog"</b> I answer confusedly, prodding the walls like a blind man.

Lars will retreat from the fog, backing up towards a wall he will quietly call out to the shadowy figures near him <b>"Hey friends. Who are you and where are we?"</B>
