## Adventure Overview
[back to Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

**Adventure Background**: For more than a century Elaria Feywing, known to many as The Master, mentored young 
adventurers in combat, exploration, and magic. Little is known about the elf woman’s past and her days as a wandering 
wizard, but her status as a teacher is legendary. Many young fortune-seekers made the trek out to the small village of 
Parabor on the frontier of the Merriam Vale to seek Elaria’s expertise. She took only a handful of these pupils every 
year. Her favorite group of disciples was also her last and most recent: the player characters.

**Characters**:

  <summary>Saurkhan Whitepelt (Rhakshasa)</summary>

</details> 
<details>
  <summary>Klaus von Stern (Gargoyle)</summary>
  Klaus is a stone gargoyle enchanted to have its own will by some wayward magician quite a long time ago. Since then he was seeking a way to stop people from running away in horror from his offers to share a drink of his homemade wines and beers, and becoming a great adventurer seemed like a good idea at that time. Klaus looks like a mobile statue, but he does wear closes (when he can catch a tailor to made them for him), especially fancy ones when he can afford it. He also wears glasses, but avoids any kind of footwear - and attempts to get gloves usually don't go well. Despite having wings, he also cannot fly - apparently breaking laws of physics is not as easy as those of biology.
  He is made from stone, and no one quite has any idea how his organism works - it's very likely that he is completely dependent on magic of that old spell cast on him. Somehow he can taste things and feel pain, and on rare occasions even get poisoned, but his pain tolerance is great and it's harder for him to get drunk (he did manage it a couple of times, though). Klaus is sophisticated and doesn't like conflict, preferring to either wait the danger while camouflaged like a statue or scare it away. He might look like a great force, big and intimidating stone wall with claws and fangs, but he is pretty bad at fighting and has no idea about how to use a weapon. Even a table leg. He also can and will try to be a peacemaker when possible, but his appearances don't really help with diplomatic approach. His profession and a hobby is winemaking - he loves brewing his own alcohol, and often succeeds at coming up with original recipes, and not just for wine, but beer and other types of drinks too. He does tend to forget limitations of other beings' biology sometimes, but he tries his best to match everyone's taste. And he loves oranges.

CHAPTER 1
---------
## Flashback

It was six months ago that Elaria Feywing, known throughout the Kingdom of Skylark as The Master, took all of you in as pupils. The old elf woman’s skills in magic, combat, and survival are legendary. She trained Marigold the Brave, who slew the infamous great blue dragon Diraxthese, and Blouton Buttertree, who closed the Demon Portal of Nargoth, and so many other famous heroes. Of all the would-be treasure seekers, mercenaries, and do-gooders that came across her doorstep begging for her wisdom, it was you who were selected by Elaria. Why did you come to The Master’s mansion?

**Rowan Cainr**: People are stupid and common, and the food and wine in this province no longer holds savor, and it no longer delights me to judge either. There must be more than this provincial life.

**Longtooth Briarsmith, the wizard (Orc cook)**: Longtooths' plan is to be able to eventualy hunt exotic game for his dishes.
