**Adventure Background**: For more than a century Elaria Feywing, known to many as The Master, mentored young 
adventurers in combat, exploration, and magic. Little is known about the elf woman’s past and her days as a wandering 
wizard, but her status as a teacher is legendary. Many young fortune-seekers made the trek out to the small village of 
Parabor on the frontier of the Merriam Vale to seek Elaria’s expertise. She took only a handful of these pupils every 
year. Her favorite group of disciples was also her last and most recent: the player characters.
