### 3.1 NPCs
[go to top](#3-other)
Players do all the rolling. NPCs do not roll. If a player hits the target, it's because the target didn't dodge. Likewise, if a player fails to dodge, it's because the enemy hit. Cause and consequence. The only things required to define an NPC character is:

<blockquote>
 <details><summary>Its goals</summary>
<i> Why is the NPC opposing the players? Is it a giant hungry spider trying to eating the players, an demonic spirit hoping to corrupt them or simply a vengeful adventure trying to get payback</i></details>
 
 <details><summary>Its actions and abilities</summary>
<i> Can the NPC bite, smash or summon inter-dimensional demon of ultimate destruction? Maybe it will simply insult and provoke the players? </i></details>
 
 <details><summary>Its combat behaviour (how it reacts to player's accumulating successes and failures?)</summary>
<i> An NPC can act more fearful as the players accumulate successes or more boldly as the players fail to act. For example, it could be defined that an NPC changes action according to the following list:<br>
Low threat NPC: change every 1 or 2 successes <br>
Medium threat NPC: change every 3 or 5 successes <br>
High threat NPC: change every 6-10 successes <br>
Heroic threat NPC: change every 10 or more successes <br> </i></details>
 
 <details><summary>Its difficulty (as defined by the enemy tier)</summary>
<i>Higher tier enemies reflect stronger enemies and will determine which skills the NPC is affect by: <br>
Skill of tier below enemy tier -1: The skill fails automatically<br>
Skill of tier equal to enemy tier -1: The skills are checked with a -1 tier penalty and reduced efficiency<br>
Skill of tier equal to enemy tier: The NPC is affected normally<br>
Skill of tier equal to enemy tier + 1: The skills are checked with a +1 tier bonus and increased efficiency<br>
Skill of tier above enemy tier +1: The skill succeeds automatically<br>
<br> Note that as higher tiered skills have lower maximum levels, even if the player's skills are of the same tier as the enemy, their changes of success are reduced for higher tier enemies.</i></details>
</blockquote>

### 3.2 Equipment
[go to top](#3-other)

<details><summary>As skills, equipment is free-form and can be defined *on the fly*. To create a new piece of equipment or item, simply name it by defining it and adding an adjective to the base name.</summary>
<i>Rusting Sword, Long Rope, Fast Horse, Long-ranged Rifle, Heavy Armour, Amazing Laser Blaster. </i></details>
<details><summary>To that, a small extra descriptor may be added if the equipment has any distinctive feature or power</summary>
<i> Compare useless robes with useless robes of might.</i></details>
Of course, super cool and legendary items can have names that are a reference to some historical or mythical place, event or person, and can be uses as opportunities for flashback chapters or as part of their character arcs.


Like skills, equipment is a way to further improve the character. Take the the following 3 ways as an example:  
<blockquote>
<details><summary><b>Apply a bonus to a skill or, more rarely, speciality</b>: There aren't really many statistics that can be affected by equipment. Equipment that provides bonus will be noted as +1/L:T (the casual penalty as -1/L:T), where +1 is the provided bonus (-1 the penalty), L the maximum level obtainable with equipment.</summary>
<i>A cheap stick is +1/1:0, meaning that players get a +1 bonus on their stick (spear/staff?) skill as long as this bonus does not result in a modifier greater than of 1 on a tier 0 skill, so the equipment has no effect for players with stick skill at level 1.<br> 
Likewise, a Balanced sword could be +1/3:2, which provides a bonus for players below sword level 3 up to tier 2. This means that you may be too skilful to actually gain any bonus from your equipment.</i></details>
<details><summary><b>The item has a descriptor which can be called:</b> This allows for more general powers or effects to be imbued in the equipment. Using descriptors allows for more flexibility in equipment creation. </summary>
<i>A poisoned dagger has poison descriptor, which can be called 3 times to induce poison on a target. <br>
A scroll of thunder has a thunder spell descriptor that can be called to use the thunder spell at the specified level. <br>
A helmet of speed has the fast descriptor, which is called to add another action to the player's turn. <br>
A hammer has the stun effect, which can be called to hit harder when out-manoeuvring an enemy.<br>
A mantle of rose scent may let you automatically convince blind creatures you're a talking rose</i></details>
<details><summary><b>Item may be used to protect the characters</b>: Particularly true for armour and magical items, these items can either reduce the wound/stress counters or prevent damage. </summary>
<i>A full plate armour may absorb the first 3 wound counters while fully repaired<br>
A magical amulet may provide immunity to fire damage twice before re-charging<br>
A magical helmet may whisper encouraging words, reducing the amount stress counters gained by 1</i></details>
<details><summary>In some settings, <b>items may be required in order to use certain skills</b>, such as spell-casting </summary>
<i> Fhe most extreme example would be that of a level 3 water magic caster that is not be able to cast any water spells if her create water ring is not equipped. This would work as a specialization of the spell book concept, where each spell is associated with an item</i></details>
</blockquote>

### 3.3 Scenes  
[go to top](#3-other)
Scenes in this system are not defined by one player only. Even though one player take the role of game master (GM), all players should have the opportunity to take control and make their own scenes, and contributing the other player's scenes:  
  
  1) Since the skill check result is immediate, the player is allowed to interpret the result of his own action. The next player can then add any interesting details that may introduce his own actions. As such, to players are allowed to interpret any single skill check. Once all players acted, the scene owner then reinterprets the entire turn taking into account the players suggestions.

  2) After introducing any new scene, place or situation, the players should add a detail to the scene. Players have the opportunity to contribute to the scene, from just adding new descriptive details to bring out different things about the places they visit, from adding a character or hinting on something that could be happening soon.

  3) This small hints and details will contribute to the player's change to play a card and take over the game. At the beginning of the game, each player picks 3 cards. Each player will then be able to add rumours, hints and clues to the story, trying to drive players into their secret story arc. Once other players take the bait, the player can play one card and discard the other 2, starting a his own scene *(that is, that player becomes the GM)*. The player can then move the character secret story arc forward, that is, players will GM their own character's arc! Whenever a new player takes over, the previous scene owner picks 3 new cards.

___
**Card suits**: Each suit reflects a different type of quest or game-play:  
  
  * Hearts are for socializers, so these should include a relevant amount of interaction with NPCs (chatty enemies, distressed peasants, negotiating passage). 
  * Diamonds are for achievers, so these include or point to some clear reward or something the players can achieve or collect (rare equipment sets, money, status). 
  * Spades are for explorers, so these should introduce new lands, explain long lost secrets or clarify some historical event or any other discovery (background information, a rumours of distant lands, a secret revealed by an solving a puzzle). 
  * Clubs are for killers, so these quests should should be filled with combat and fights (challenges of power, all out combat, arenas)

**Card values**: The numeric values of the cards illustrate the challenge of the conflict, so cards with higher values will present more danger to the players (be it the number of enemies, successes required, total enemy tier, situational penalties, having the players surprised, etc.). Royals will represent important named enemies (possibly recurring enemies). A Joker is a quest that has a change to gain a bless or new ability or in some way provide a significant improvement *(being knighted by the king could be as important as a new ability!)* while Aces represent conflicts leading to new friendly or helpful connection.
