## 2. Conflict

### 2.1 Structure
*[top]()*  

The game is started by the Game Master (GM), which is the player that  defined the overall setting and game story. However, besides this main story, each charatcer has an individual motivation, a goal or a story to explore. To accumodate this, **the system is organized into scenes**, where each player may own (GM) any given scene. A scene is a self-contained part of a story, such as a mission or a dungeon, that the charatcers decided to pursue. So, even though only one player takes the role of GM at any time, the other players have the opportunity to contribute to it (besides their charatcer actions) and eventually take control and run their own scenes. Same way to do so are:
  
  > Since the skill check result is immediate, the player is allowed to interpret the result of his own action. The next player can then add any interesting details that may introduce his own actions. As such, to players are allowed to interpret any single skill check. Once all players acted, the scene owner then reinterprets the entire turn taking into account the players suggestions.
  
  > After a new scene, place or situation is introduced, the players should add a detail to the scene by suggesting some detail their character notices. This way, all players have the opportunity to contribute to the scene, from simply adding new descriptive details and bringing out different things about the places they visit, from adding a character or hinting on something that could be happening soon.
  
To **take over the scene** a player must first build up enough information for the other players to follow one of their quests. At the beginning of the game, each player picks 3 cards. Each player will then be able to add rumours, hints and clues to the story, passively gathered from reasonable "information" sources. These small pieces of information are used to drive players into their secret story arc. Once other players take the "bait" and decide to follow these tips, the player can play one card and discard the other 2, starting a his own scene. The player playing the card can then move the character secret story arc a bit forward! Whenever a new player takes over, the previous scene owner picks 3 new cards. 
  
  > **Card suits**: Each suit of the card played to take over the scene reflects the type of quest or game-play to use:  
  *Hearts are for socializers*, so these should include a relevant amount of interaction with NPCs (chatty enemies, distressed peasants, negotiating passage).  
  *Diamonds are for achievers*, so these include or point to some clear reward or something the players can achieve or collect (rare equipment sets, money, status).  
  *Spades are for explorers*, so these should introduce new lands, explain long lost secrets or clarify some historical event or any other discovery (background information, a rumours of distant lands, a secret revealed by an solving a puzzle).  
  *Clubs are for killers*, so these quests should should be filled with combat and fights (challenges of power, all out combat, arenas)  
  
  > **Card values**: Two of the cards in the player's hand can be discarded to provide the scene owner with rumours at any suitable time, up to the numeric value of the card. The scene owner is then responsible for making sure the rumors get to the charatcer's hears. Royals will represent important named enemies (possibly recurring enemies) will appear, instead of rumours, while Aces represent a new friendly or helpful connection. A Joker is an important event with far reaching implication that may change the current status-quo.

This system uses turns to structure the game, where **each turn is made by a single intervention from every player**. The turn structure is always used, and is not just for combat situations. This should give the opportunity for every player to take an action if he wishes to do so. At the begging of each turn, the previous actions are resolved, the consequences described and the new situation introduced. Each players then explains how the chacter will respond to the new situation, whi a new turn starting once all character have an intended action. Importantly, **all actions within a turn occurs simultaneously** so there is no clear initiative or turn order. As such, all actions will be resolved in the order the scene owner find most appropriate. 

**Conflict arises any time the outcome of a players' actions is uncertain**.

<details><summary>All conflicts are solved with a narrative, <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/355-how-to-run-combat-in-the-theater-of-the-mind" target="_blank">theatre of the mind</a> approach, where the results from the previous turn inform on the behaviour of the NPCs on the next turn.</summary>
  <i>This is to say that, for example, a dragon does not have to be bashed to a pulp of negative HP to be defeated. Its actions are determined by the number of successes and failures the players accumulated during the conflict, where each success reflect a new action, approach or consideration noticeable by the players.</i></details>


#### 2.2 Actions
*[top](#)*  

call descriptor, define positive effect and negative effect.

During conflict, **each player is allowed to move and choose one other actions each turn** with a potential defence action being called if the character is attacked. Actions are free-form and if the player comes up with an idea, that should be implemented within reason. As such, **each player calls for an action by describing it and its intentions.** Basic actions include:

  > **Move action**: cover 1 "space" of movement.  
  > **Attack action**: actively attempt to damage a target's position (either with sword or word!)  
  > **Defence action**: protect from an adversary's attack or insult (dodge, shield, rebuke, etc.)  
  > **Manoeuvre action**: try to impose a disadvantage on a target (disarm, hide, gain terrain advantage, etc.)  
  > **Interact action**: interact with items, be it picking them from the floor or from a bag, reloading a weapon or drinking a potion, etc.  
  > **Recover action**: recover from a previous attack or simply fall back to overview the battle field or catch some breath.

*Note that* each actions called should correspond to a skill (or ability). If an action requires a non-existent skill, simply add it to the list at level 0. If it wasn't there to start with, it is fair to assume the characters have no experience with it. However, consider the character's background and, if it would be reasonable for the character to have some experience in the skill, allow it to start at level 2.

___

**Stances**: However, given the limited scope of these basic actions, the players may attempt to take a stance, adding more strategic options to the conflice. Stances reflect how the character is currently approaching conflict. Based on the intended approach, the player can call a stance [effect](#24-conflict-effects) to: 
  
<details><summary>Gamble an action for additional bonus.</summary>
  <i>An aggressive player may wish to gamble away the defence action to attempt a new attack, depending on the first attack being successful, or a fighter may gamble away his success changes in order to attack an extra target by attacking twice with a -1 level penalty.</i></details>
<details><summary>Shifting bonus and penalties to improve a specific action. </summary>
  <i>A defensive character may wish to take a +1 defensive bonus in exchange for a -1 attack bonus or a manoeuvring character may put his efforts on outsmarting the target for a +1 manoeuvre bonus and the cost of a -1 defence penalty.</i><br></details>
<br>
  
**Movement**: In this system, there are no grids, maps or any other sort of objective locations and positions during conflicts. The general layout is described, highlighting particularities that could be used for or against the players and all characters involved will start in relative positions to each other. Each character can be:  
  
  > **Close**: Can be attacked normally with melee weapons, but with a -1 stress penalty for ranged weapons and magic. If hit once, ranged attackers (including spell-casters) will be forced into a defensive position and see their attack disrupted.  
  > **Nearby**: Enemies can be attacked with melee weapons (after moving), long reach weapons, ranged weapons and magic.  
  > **In range**: Enemies can be attacked with ranged weapons and magic.  
  > **Out of reach**: Enemies can be attacked only with higher powered magic (count as +1 tier enemy).

*Note that* these positions are not linearly spaced. Because all positions are relative to the players, all players occupy the close space at all times and need to move 1 "space" to a *nearby* position, 2 "spaces" to get to an *in range* target or 4 "spaces" to reach an *out of reach* target. 

#### 2.3 Resolution
*[top](#)*  

<details><summary>When a player wants to do an action, the player calls on it and describes the intended effect. If the action's result is uncertain, then the character is in a conflict situation. To resolve the conflict, the character must name a relevant skill to check for the action's success.</summary>
<i>A player wants to climb a steep wall to sneak into the Baron's private garden. Given the height of the wall, the result of this action is uncertain and a conflict is started. The player can then choose from any reasonable skills, such as climb or jump, and make a skill check to find out what happens</i></details>

**Success range**: To determine if an action is successful, roll a 2d6 and sum the result. If that result is contained by the success range, that is, it is one of the success numbers, then the action is successful. The success range root value is 5 and how far it extends, depends on the applicable modifiers:  
  tie in the raise/give mechanistic with frustration, but untie frustration from insanity
  
  
<details><summary>A positive modifier <b>adds numbers above 5</b> to the success range, one number per each +1 in the modifier. This means that the success range will be all numbers between 5 and 5 + modifier (both included).</summary>
<i>If it is determined that the character has a modifier of +3 for the climb skill, then the success range will have the root 5 and 3 more values: 6,7 and 8. Success will occur if the rolled sum is one of those 4 values. Note that the success range is from 5 to 5+3.</i></details>
<details><summary>A negative modifier <b>moves the root below 5</b>, one value for each -1 in the modifier.</summary>
<i>Another character tries to follow and has the modifier of -2. This means that the success root will be moved down twice, that is from 5 to 3. Success in this case will only occurs if the rolled sum is 3.</i></details>  
  
> *The success range, even though simple, is a fairly strange concept for many players and may take a while to get used to.* An alternative method can be derived by subtracting 5 to the result. Given that the success range from 5 to 5+modifier, rolling 2d6-5 will mean that the success range is now from 5-5 to 5-5+modifier, that is from 0 to the modifier. The result is converted to a *roll less than the modifier* type of system for positive modifiers or *roll equal to modifier* for negative modifiers.

**Modifiers**: The modifier that defines the success range is the sum of all bonuses and penalties that apply to the skill being checked, including:

<details><summary><i>The Skill level</i>: The skill level is added as a bonus for the action.</summary>
<i>A character with a skill level 4 adds a bonus of +4 to the modifier</i></details>
  
<details><summary><i>The Speciality value</i>: Each type of conflict reflects a situation that should be covered by one of the specialities.</summary>
<i>Note that this implies that the same skill can have very different success rates depending on the situation. For example, a character with a sword skill of 3 and Brawl speciality of +1 and Mingle speciality of -1 will have a modifier of 4 when trying to cut down a goblin, but only a modifier of 2 if showing off his sword skills to someone. This can be interpreted as the character being awkward handling his sword, but it still cuts when it hits a goblin!</i></details>

<details><summary><i>Situational</i> +1 bonuses and -1 penalties may be applied depending on conditions affecting the character or to particular action difficulties.</summary>
<i>If the character gets into a tavern brawl with drunk clients, then maybe it is easier to dodge and a +1 bonus is applied. Dodging a goblin's sword is a normal effort, so no change is applied, but dodging a giant's sweeping club, is probably more difficult, providing a -1 penalty.</i></details>

<details><summary><i>Fatigue</i>: Each time a skill is used and a 6 is rolled in either die, a cumulative -1 fatigue penalty is added to the skill, preventing the character from constantly using the same skill.</summary>
<i>If a character with the climb skill level 3 continuous to climb a mountain, he will risk becoming fatigued. For example, the player rolls a 6, getting a -1 penalty on the climbing skill. If the player was to roll another 6, the character would have accumulated a -2 fatigue penalty.</i></details>
<br>
<details><summary><b>Abilities</b>: Abilities work a bit differently than skills because they represent a special use of a given skill. As such, if an ability succeeds, the additional effect occurs, while if it fails, the roll defaults to the original skill with a drawback effect. </summary>
<i>A character attempts to use its Iaijutsu counter ability level 2 attached to his sword skill level 4 and rolls a 9. The ability will fail but the base sword skill still succeeds! This means that the character will not be able to counter-attack (ability effect) but it will strike its target (sword skill) as the ability check defaults to the attached skill. However this comes with a drawback, for example, failing its Iaijutsu sets the character off-balance and it will have a -1 defence penalty, regardless of the result of the base sword skill. </i></details>
<br>


**Failure handling**: If a character succeeds, them the action is completed as intended. However, there are many ways of failing. The most important thing to keep in mind is that failure should keep the story flowing instead of bringing it to a halt, leaving the players with no options or just delaying the inevitable by allowing infinite re-rolls. Failure handling should assume that given time and resources, the players will not fail unless something happens. From this follows that failure is an opportunity to add complications, twist and new developments to the story that the players need to consider. So, instead of simply failing, the players can call on their failed descriptor to handle the action. Consider the following failure effects:  
  
<details><summary><i>The action is time-sensitive</i>: Failing allows a limited number of repetitions, gradually increasing the tension with each failure.  </summary>
<i>A tyrant lord is about to execute the hostages, one by one. As infiltrated agents, the players try to convince him that sparing the prisoners would be wiser, because the princess they want to rescue is the fourth hostage in the line of execution. Each failure will result in another slain hostage.</i></details>

<details><summary><i>The action is interrupted</i>: Failing once prevents the action from being repeated because something else happened, not because the player isn't skilled enough to do it.  </summary>
<i>The player tries to jump over a wagon to get a clear shot at the tyrant lord, however, the wagon's owner shows up and starts to chat about the on-going public execution with the player.</i></details>  

<details><summary><i>The action succeeds anyway</i>: Fail forward is an interesting concept that allows the player to succeed even if they fail, but with an added twist or complication. It is similar to having the action interrupted, but it allows for the player to get what he wants.  </summary>
<i>As the player is looking for the incriminating secret papers in the tyrant lord's office, even though the player manages to identify and take them, the paper weight that was on the table is dropped, making a very noticeable noise. </i></details>

<details><summary><i>Forced success</i>: When a player fails an action, it can be converted to a success by pushing the character to its limits.  </summary>
<i>1) In dire circunstances, the players may be allowed to succed, but rolling a 2d6 and taking the lowest value as wounds or frustration, whichever makes the most narrative sense. <br> 
  2) On the other hand, some skills don't make sense failing, like buffing magic on a willing target. Failing, in such cases can be hanlded as forced success and reduced the effect frok the highest values rolled to the lowest.
  3) Failing could also add descriptors and penalties to the character as required or simply inform the narrative.</i></details>
<br>

<details><summary><u>Narration effects</u>: To keep thinks more interesting, when a 1 is rolled in any dice, a narrative effect may be called. This effect is call to add a *but* to the action resolution, attenuating the results of the action. So for a failed roll, the player fails but there was something positive, while for a successful roll there was a consequence unaccounted. </summary>
<i> 1) The player tries to hide before the guards come into the room. He fails to find a place to hide, but he notices an open window through which he can escape.<br>
  2) The player successfully spots a secret passage on the wall, but the opening mechanism seems to be stuck.</i></details>
<details><summary>Another narrative effect is related to the effectiveness of the skill. In this case, the value by which the player succedds or fails, will determine how good sthe success was. </summary>
<i> * If the success was with a sum of 5, then it represent a weak success from an untrained character, counting as half a success.<br>
   * If the success was with a sum of 6,7, 8 or 9, then it represent a regular success from a trained character, and counts as 1 success<br>
   * If the success was with a sum equal to 10 or more, then it represent a great success from a master, as it counts as twice a success.<br>
  * If a failure happens with a sum that is above the maximum success value by 3, then it represent a particularly bad failure and the character takes the lowest value as wounds or frustration.</i></details>
<br>
**Helping**: An help effect can be called whenever players can justify it. Help provides a +1 bonus to the action per helping source. Generally, successful actions from other players will be evocked to justify the help bonus, but other reason could be concidered, such as information from knowledge skills, narrative effects from rolling 1 or specific descriptiors that may apply.
