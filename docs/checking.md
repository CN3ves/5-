**Skills** level up using a “learn by doing” system. Every time a skill descriptor is called and a double is rolled that is, both dice show the same value, if that value is above the skill level, it gains a new level. If the value is not above the skill level, 1 experience point (XP) is gained. 
  
Accumulated XP can be used to further develop the character in more general ways. XP represent the general learning accumulated during the adventure, thus it can be used to "buy" both skills and abilities:  
  
  * The number of XP required to level up a skill level equals 3 times the level being bough. 
> *Level 3 skill requires 8 XP to level up*
  * The number of XP required to buy a new ability/trait equals 5 times the number of abilities/traits already known by the character. 
> *A character with 4 abilities will buy a fifth with 12XP.*  
  * Buying a skill that the character is untrained (that is, buying training), includes buying the training (trait) descriptor and the actual *in character* training expenses. Training allows the level 0 skill to be used.
  * Improving existing resistances cost 10 times the current break-point for +1 to the break-point. Every third improvement is on the resistence point, instead.
