### 1.1 Character Creation  
[go to top](#1-characters)

<details>
  <summary>1. Define the character concept using a two or three word description.</summary>
  <i>For example, you can consider the common race/class/specialization as a starting point (Elven Wizard of Illusion) or add adjectives to your background (Educated and Charming Noble).</i>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>2. Choose the character's general <a href="#12-character-specialities">strength and weakness</a>, if any.</summary>
  <i>In what type of situations would the character feel more comfortable? Did the character have extensive combat training? Maybe the character prefers to spend time with others? Or perhaps the character has spend most of his time dealing with intricate equipment?</i>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>3. Think how you wish to role-play the character, and what <a href="#13-character-skills">sort of actions</a> you'd want it to do. </summary>
  <i>Will the character walk in the shadows, spying on his enemies? Or will it solve most problems at sword's point? Will the character control the elements or channel life into others?</i>
</details>
  
<details>
  <summary>4. Determine if there are any defining characteristics that distinguishes the character.</summary>
  <i>For example, are there any inheritable racial features, or particular cultural or professional skills that may be acquired? Perhaps some personal ability gained from past experiences? How would these traits work?</i>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>5. Consider how your character will react to the ever increasing <a href="#25-wounds-and-stress">frustration and stress</a> of adventuring.</summary>
  <i>How does the character behave under stress or when the frustration is too just too much to handle? Will it retreat from society or pray to the gods? Will the character become aggressive and arrogant? Will it just break down and cry itself to sleep?</i>
</details>
  
### 1.2 Character specialities
[go to top](#1-characters)

Specialities reflect the general aptitudes the characters have for [*specific situations*](#21-conflict-structure). These mostly remain constant throughout the character's adventuring life:  

> **Brawl**: Reflects an extensive battle and combat training, both psychical and mental. Influences the character's effectiveness when in violent confrontation with other creatures *(combat situations)*. 
  
> **Mingle**: Reflects an extensive understanding of others' motives, desires and feelings. Influences the character's effectiveness when interacting non-violently with sentient creatures *(social situations)*. 
  
> **Check**: Reflects a particular eye for details and understanding what they mean. Influences the character's effectiveness when dealing with objects and finding out-of-place details *(other situations)*.
<details>
  <summary><u><i>At Character Creation...</i></u></summary>
  All specialities are set to 0, reflecting an average effectiveness for each type situation. A player can choose one single speciality that his character excels at (+1), by sacrificing another speciality (-1), indicating that the character spent more time than usual with one type of situation, and consequently less time than usual practising the other.
</details>

### 1.3 Character skills
[go to top](#1-characters)

If the specialities are what distinguishes the characters' broad strengths or weaknesses, skills are the fine differences that will make a character unique. Skills refer to anything a character may do *and so include every possible action that can fail and be improved*, from using weapons and armour to interacting with other creatures and objects. While the specialities are a small set of limited options, the idea is to have a free and fluid skill's list, allowing skills to be made up *on the fly* as required. Skills measure how good the character is at doing a given action and are defined by their level (mastery) and tier (power). 

For example, skills could be broadly divided into the following categories:

<blockquote>
<details>
  <summary><b>Combat skills</b>: Use of weapons and armour as well as tactical evaluations.</summary>

### 1.4 Character progression  
[go to top](#1-characters)  
In this system, characters do not level up or gain quanta of power at certain points in a deterministic way. They age and gain experience as one does! Characters can progress, or improve, in 3 different ways: gain experience with skills, acquire better [equipment](#32-equipment) and learn new abilities. Skills (and abilities) level up using a “learn by doing” system, matching the intended skills’ fluid dynamics and flexibility:  
  
  1. Every time you roll a 2d6 for a skill check, if the result is a double (same value on both dice) you level up that skill if the value shown (twice) is above your *current skill level plus skill tier*. 
  2. *When you reach level 4 of a skill*, you upgrade your skill to a higher tier.
  3. *Once you reach the maximum level of a skill* (level up with a double 6), add a permanent +1 bonus to the same skill on the next tier.
  
**Upgrading**: While the skill level represents how successful the character is using the skill, the skill tier reflects advances in the power, specificity, methodology and deeper understanding of the skill. Higher power and more advanced methods are more difficult to handle. When upgrading a skill tier, you gain:  
  
  1. Training (+1 level) on another skill of the current tier.   
    
  2. A new level 0 (tier 0) [ability](#15-character-abilities) attached to your skill. These abilities should provide special effects on top of the base skill.   
  <details><summary>3. A higher tier version of the same skill at level 0 (but you maintain the previous skill!)</summary>
  <i>For example a character with the Use Poisons skills at tier 0 and level 3 rolls double 4s. As such, the character upgrades the skill from Use Poisons (3) to Use Poisons (4:0). This notation shows the level of the skill for each tiers unlocked. Since higher tiers reflect the use of stronger poisons and the different safety methods associated with handling them, the player may use the skill at tier 0 level 4 or at tier 1 level 0 depending on the situation.</i> 
  </details><br>
<details><summary><b>Training</b>: Characters can only use skills that reflect their concept and background. As such, all characters are considered untrained in all unsuitable skills unless agreed otherwise. All characters are allowed to train and study to unlock skills as fitting to the story and game setting. </summary>
  <i>An uneducated tribal warrior may automatically fail magic/technological skills and some "civilised" knowledge (dynastic succession rules) and social skills (court etiquette) for example</i> 
  </details>  

### 1.5 Character abilities  
[go to top](#1-characters)  

<details><summary>With skills being all the actions that a character may do, abilities are the extra twist the character adds to the skill. Abilities provide the opportunity to add special effects to a skill, reflecting the character improvement and mastery, and the personal take on the way skills can be used. </summary>
  <i> For example:<br>
  * Upgrading Sword skill you may gain the Iaijutsu ability (counter attack on defence).<br>
  * Upgrading Fire spell: you may gain the Burning Bolt ability (burn condition) or Fire Ball (+1 target). <br>
  * Upgrading History knowledge: you may gain the more specialised knowledge about Noble Families (ability).</i> <br>
  </details>  
  
As such, abilities are *attached* to a given skill. Despite the similarities, abilities progression differs from skill progression as:  
  
  1. Abilities' level is capped at a level below the skill they are attached to. As such, abilities do not reach the maximum level (roll double 6 only to level up) and do not provide the maximum level +1 bonus.
  2. Upgrading an ability to the next tier does not provide training to a skill or a new ability, it simply unlocks a more higher tier version of the ability.
