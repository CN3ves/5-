### 2.1 Conflict Structure
[go to top](#2-conflict)

This system uses turns to structure the game, where **each turn is made by a single intervention from every player**, giving the opportunity for every player to take an action if he wishes to do so. Importantly, **all actions within a turn occurs simultaneously** so there is no clear initiative or turn order. At the begging of each turn, the previous actions are resolved, the consequences described and the new situation introduced. **Conflict arises any time the outcome of a players' actions is uncertain**. As such, each conflict should reflect a specific situations matching one of the [character's specialities](#12-character-specialities). 

<details><summary>All conflicts are solved with a narrative, <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/355-how-to-run-combat-in-the-theater-of-the-mind" target="_blank">theatre of the mind</a> approach, where the results from the previous turn inform on the behaviour of the NPCs on the next turn.</summary>
  <i>This is to say that, for example, a dragon does not have to be bashed to a pulp of negative HP to be defeated. Its actions are determined by the number of successes and failures the players accumulated during the conflict, where each success reflect a new action, approach or consideration noticeable by the players.</i></details>
    

### 2.2 Conflict actions
[go to top](#2-conflict)

During conflict, **each player is allowed to move and choose one other actions each turn** with a potential defence action being called if the character is attacked. Actions are free-form and if the player comes up with an idea, that should be implemented within reason. As such, **each player calls for an action by describing it and its intentions.** Basic actions include:

  > **Move action**: cover 1 "space" of movement.  
  > **Attack action**: actively attempt to damage a target's position (either with sword or word!)  
  > **Defence action**: protect from an adversary's attack or insult (dodge, shield, rebuke, etc.)  
  > **Manoeuvre action**: try to impose a disadvantage on a target (disarm, hide, gain terrain advantage, etc.)  
  > **Interact action**: interact with items, be it picking them from the floor or from a bag, reloading a weapon or drinking a potion, etc.  
  > **Recover action**: recover from a previous attack or simply fall back to overview the battle field or catch some breath.

*Note that* each actions called should correspond to a skill (or ability). If an action requires a non-existent skill, simply add it to the list at level 0. If it wasn't there to start with, it is fair to assume the characters have no experience with it. However, consider the character's background and, if it would be reasonable for the character to have some experience in the skill, allow it to start at level 2.

___

**Stances**: However, given the limited scope of these basic actions, the players may attempt to take a stance, adding more strategic options to the conflice. Stances reflect how the character is currently approaching conflict. Based on the intended approach, the player can call a stance [effect](#24-conflict-effects) to: 
  
<details><summary>Gamble an action for additional bonus.</summary>
  <i>An aggressive player may wish to gamble away the defence action to attempt a new attack, depending on the first attack being successful, or a fighter may gamble away his success changes in order to attack an extra target by attacking twice with a -1 level penalty.</i></details>
<details><summary>Shifting bonus and penalties to improve a specific action. </summary>
  <i>A defensive character may wish to take a +1 defensive bonus in exchange for a -1 attack bonus or a manoeuvring character may put his efforts on outsmarting the target for a +1 manoeuvre bonus and the cost of a -1 defence penalty.</i><br></details>
<br>
  
**Movement**: In this system, there are no grids, maps or any other sort of objective locations and positions during conflicts. The general layout is described, highlighting particularities that could be used for or against the players and all characters involved will start in relative positions to each other. Each character can be:  
  
  > **Close**: Can be attacked normally with melee weapons, but with a -1 stress penalty for ranged weapons and magic. If hit once, ranged attackers (including spell-casters) will be forced into a defensive position and see their attack disrupted.  
  > **Nearby**: Enemies can be attacked with melee weapons (after moving), long reach weapons, ranged weapons and magic.  
  > **In range**: Enemies can be attacked with ranged weapons and magic.  
  > **Out of reach**: Enemies can be attacked only with higher powered magic (count as +1 tier enemy).

*Note that* these positions are not linearly spaced. Because all positions are relative to the players, all players occupy the close space at all times and need to move 1 "space" to a *nearby* position, 2 "spaces" to get to an *in range* target or 4 "spaces" to reach an *out of reach* target. 

## 2.3 Conflict Resolution
[go to top](#2-conflict)

<details><summary>When a player wants to do an action, the player calls on it and describes the intended effect. If the action's result is uncertain, then the character is in a conflict situation. To resolve the conflict, the character must name a relevant skill to check for the action's success.</summary>
<i>A player wants to climb a steep wall to sneak into the Baron's private garden. Given the height of the wall, the result of this action is uncertain and a conflict is started. The player can then choose from any reasonable skills, such as climb or jump, and make a skill check to find out what happens</i></details>

**Success range**: To determine if an action is successful, roll a 2d6 and sum the result. If that result is contained by the success range, that is, it is one of the success numbers, then the action is successful. The success range root value is 5 and how far it extends, depends on the applicable modifiers:  
  
<details><summary>A positive modifier <b>adds numbers above 5</b> to the success range, one number per each +1 in the modifier. This means that the success range will be all numbers between 5 and 5 + modifier (both included).</summary>
<i>If it is determined that the character has a modifier of +3 for the climb skill, then the success range will have the root 5 and 3 more values: 6,7 and 8. Success will occur if the rolled sum is one of those 4 values. Note that the success range is from 5 to 5+3.</i></details>
<details><summary>A negative modifier <b>moves the root below 5</b>, one value for each -1 in the modifier.</summary>
<i>Another character tries to follow and has the modifier of -2. This means that the success root will be moved down twice, that is from 5 to 3. Success in this case will only occurs if the rolled sum is 3.</i></details>  
  
> *The success range, even though simple, is a fairly strange concept for many players and may take a while to get used to.* An alternative method can be derived by subtracting 5 to the result. Given that the success range from 5 to 5+modifier, rolling 2d6-5 will mean that the success range is now from 5-5 to 5-5+modifier, that is from 0 to the modifier. The result is converted to a *roll less than the modifier* type of system for positive modifiers or *roll equal to modifier* for negative modifiers.

**Modifiers**: The modifier that defines the success range is the sum of all bonuses and penalties that apply to the skill being checked, including:

<details><summary><i>The Skill level</i>: The skill level is added as a bonus for the action.</summary>
<i>A character with a skill level 4 adds a bonus of +4 to the modifier</i></details>
  
<details><summary><i>The Speciality value</i>: Each type of conflict reflects a situation that should be covered by one of the specialities.</summary>
<i>Note that this implies that the same skill can have very different success rates depending on the situation. For example, a character with a sword skill of 3 and Brawl speciality of +1 and Mingle speciality of -1 will have a modifier of 4 when trying to cut down a goblin, but only a modifier of 2 if showing off his sword skills to someone. This can be interpreted as the character being awkward handling his sword, but it still cuts when it hits a goblin!</i></details>

<details><summary><i>Situational</i> +1 bonuses and -1 penalties may be applied depending on conditions affecting the character or to particular action difficulties.</summary>
<i>If the character gets into a tavern brawl with drunk clients, then maybe it is easier to dodge and a +1 bonus is applied. Dodging a goblin's sword is a normal effort, so no change is applied, but dodging a giant's sweeping club, is probably more difficult, providing a -1 penalty.</i></details>

<details><summary><i>Fatigue</i>: Each time a skill is used and a 6 is rolled in either die, a cumulative -1 fatigue penalty is added to the skill, preventing the character from constantly using the same skill.</summary>
<i>If a character with the climb skill level 3 continuous to climb a mountain, he will risk becoming fatigued. For example, the player rolls a 6, getting a -1 penalty on the climbing skill. If the player was to roll another 6, the character would have accumulated a -2 fatigue penalty.</i></details>
<br>
<details><summary><b>Abilities</b>: Abilities work a bit differently than skills because they represent a special use of a given skill. As such, if an ability succeeds, the additional effect occurs, while if it fails, the roll defaults to the original skill with a drawback effect. </summary>
<i>A character attempts to use its Iaijutsu counter ability level 2 attached to his sword skill level 4 and rolls a 9. The ability will fail but the base sword skill still succeeds! This means that the character will not be able to counter-attack (ability effect) but it will strike its target (sword skill) as the ability check defaults to the attached skill. However this comes with a drawback, for example, failing its Iaijutsu sets the character off-balance and it will have a -1 defence penalty, regardless of the result of the base sword skill. </i></details>
<br>

### 2.4 Conflict effects
[go to top](#2-conflict)

<details><summary><b>Descriptors</b>: During the adventure, characters will often experience unexpected conditions, situations and difficulties. Descriptors reflect any unusual effect the character is under, either mechanistically or dramatically, including situational bonuses, condition penalties or any other effect than is not the default character state: </summary>
<i> A poisoned character may feel weaker, a paralysed character wouldn't be able to move, while a character with a broken arm may just be able to carry on almost unaffected, avoiding using its arm. </i></details>
<details><summary>Generally, conditions provide a +1 bonus or -1 penalty when calling an action on which their effect can logically be associated.</summary>
<i> A character with a hidden descriptor will gain a +1 bonus when trying a surprise attack, whereas a weakened character will gain -1 penalty to moving furniture into the new apartment. </i></details>
<details><summary>However, specific descriptors may reflect stronger penalties, effectively preventing certain actions. </summary>
<i> Being asleep or petrified will prevent moving or taking actions, while a character that is muted or silenced will not be able to talk, and having a broken arm will prevent the character from using two handed weapons. </i></details>
<details><summary>The default effect of a descriptor is defined when the descriptor is acquired. To avoid these default penalties, the player can call on the descriptor effect as well, paying a higher cost now for a chance of improving the effects. </summary>
<i> 1) A poisoned character receives a -1 penalty for any physical skills. However, the player may call on the poison effect, suggesting that the character suddenly feels a bit dizzy from the conflict effort and takes some time to recover. At the cost of skipping a turn, the poison's default modifier will be ignored for the number of turns equal to the lowest value of a 2d6 roll, reflecting the characters recovered focus after taking some time to rest. <br>
2) On the other hand, a player may call on the sleeping effect to wake up a character immediately, but having a -1 sleepy or unprepared penalty for the number of turns equal to the highest value of a 2d6 roll. <br>
3) Finally, a character with optimal positioning may give up his +1 bonus for an extra or stronger attack, inducing a descriptior on the enemy such as the disarmed or the panic condition.</i></details>
Players should feel free to call on custom effect and add new and unique takes on the descriptors. In general, calling on an effect allows players to make a tradeoff.


**Failure handling**: If a character succeeds, them the action is completed as intended. However, there are many ways of failing. The most important thing to keep in mind is that failure should keep the story flowing instead of bringing it to a halt, leaving the players with no options or just delaying the inevitable by allowing infinite re-rolls. Failure handling should assume that given time and resources, the players will not fail unless something happens. From this follows that failure is an opportunity to add complications, twist and new developments to the story that the players need to consider. So, instead of simply failing, the players can call on their failed descriptor to handle the action. Consider the following failure effects:  
  
<details><summary><i>The action is time-sensitive</i>: Failing allows a limited number of repetitions, gradually increasing the tension with each failure.  </summary>
<i>A tyrant lord is about to execute the hostages, one by one. As infiltrated agents, the players try to convince him that sparing the prisoners would be wiser, because the princess they want to rescue is the fourth hostage in the line of execution. Each failure will result in another slain hostage.</i></details>

<details><summary><i>The action is interrupted</i>: Failing once prevents the action from being repeated because something else happened, not because the player isn't skilled enough to do it.  </summary>
<i>The player tries to jump over a wagon to get a clear shot at the tyrant lord, however, the wagon's owner shows up and starts to chat about the on-going public execution with the player.</i></details>  

<details><summary><i>The action succeeds anyway</i>: Fail forward is an interesting concept that allows the player to succeed even if they fail, but with an added twist or complication. It is similar to having the action interrupted, but it allows for the player to get what he wants.  </summary>
<i>As the player is looking for the incriminating secret papers in the tyrant lord's office, even though the player manages to identify and take them, the paper weight that was on the table is dropped, making a very noticeable noise. </i></details>

<details><summary><i>Forced success</i>: When a player fails an action, it can be converted to a success by pushing the character to its limits.  </summary>
<i>1) In dire circunstances, the players may be allowed to succed, but rolling a 2d6 and taking the lowest value as wounds or frustration, whichever makes the most narrative sense. <br> 
  2) On the other hand, some skills don't make sense failing, like buffing magic on a willing target. Failing, in such cases can be hanlded as forced success and reduced the effect frok the highest values rolled to the lowest.
  3) Failing could also add descriptors and penalties to the character as required or simply inform the narrative.</i></details>
<br>

<details><summary><u>Narration effects</u>: To keep thinks more interesting, when a 1 is rolled in any dice, a narrative effect may be called. This effect is call to add a *but* to the action resolution, attenuating the results of the action. So for a failed roll, the player fails but there was something positive, while for a successful roll there was a consequence unaccounted. </summary>
<i> 1) The player tries to hide before the guards come into the room. He fails to find a place to hide, but he notices an open window through which he can escape.<br>
  2) The player successfully spots a secret passage on the wall, but the opening mechanism seems to be stuck.</i></details>
<details><summary>Another narrative effect is related to the effectiveness of the skill. In this case, the value by which the player succedds or fails, will determine how good sthe success was. </summary>
<i> * If the success was with a sum of 5, then it represent a weak success from an untrained character, counting as half a success.<br>
   * If the success was with a sum of 6,7, 8 or 9, then it represent a regular success from a trained character, and counts as 1 success<br>
   * If the success was with a sum equal to 10 or more, then it represent a great success from a master, as it counts as twice a success.<br>
  * If a failure happens with a sum that is above the maximum success value by 3, then it represent a particularly bad failure and the character takes the lowest value as wounds or frustration.</i></details>
<br>
**Helping**: An help effect can be called whenever players can justify it. Help provides a +1 bonus to the action per helping source. Generally, successful actions from other players will be evocked to justify the help bonus, but other reason could be concidered, such as information from knowledge skills, narrative effects from rolling 1 or specific descriptiors that may apply. 

### 2.5 Wounds and Stress  
[go to top](#2-conflict)  
Adventuring puts a lot of pressure both on the body and mind, resulting in wounds, frustration and stress. Physical and mental (stress/frustration) wounds have a maximum of 10 levels, at which point the character is exhausted from accumulated wounds or loses his mind completely, becoming unplayable. By having more than 5 levels on one of these, the player risks permanent damage in the form of a new descriptor. When acquiring a wounds or stress ,


**Physical wounds**: At any time a character fails a skill roll would result in damage, keep the lowest value die and add a "damage counter" to the character. If the number of counter is above the value of the kept die, the character receives that value as levels of wounds. The "damage counter" is restarted at the end of a conflict. Healing minor wounds *(wound level below 5)* requires simple treatment that can be provided by anyone, reducing the wound level by the lowest value on the 2d6 check. However, major wounds *(wound level above 4) require trained medical treatment and access to adequate equipment and supplies. A trained check reduces the level by the highest value on the 2d6 roll. If a character gets new wound levels when he already has received major wounds, it risks permanent damage in the form of a new descriptor. In addition to the regular wound check, if the sum of the failed skill roll is below the wound level, then a new wound description is gained which may not be recoverable from. 

**Mental stress**: At any time a character fails an active action to attempt something, keep the lowest value die and add a "stress counter" to the character. If the number of counter is above the value of the kept die, the character receives that value as levels of stress. The "stress counter" is restarted at the end of a conflict. Recovering from frustration *(stress level below 5)* requires a simple down-time rest, with 1 stress level recovered per each period of relaxation and enjoyment. However, burn-out *(stress level above 4) requires complete night rest and low danger down-time activities, reducing the stress level by the lowest value of a 2d6. If a character gets new stress level when he is already burned-out, it risks mental break down and permanent effect in the form of a new descriptor. In addition to the regular stress check, if the sum of the failed skill roll is below the stress level, then a new stress description is gained which may not be recoverable from. 

**Frustration trait**: The frustration trait reflects the unrestrained inner self of the charterer and how it "explodes" when the stress of adventure is too much and it needs to vent out the accumulated frustration. Players may decide to have their characters became frustrated any time. A frustrated character gains the following benefits:  
  
  * It can remove all stress counters if the frustration trait is used
  * It recovers frustration levels twice as fast for minor relaxing moments, including when burned-out
  * It recovers the highest value for the long term stress reductions (sleep and down-time)
