Welcome to my little page for developing and testing the 4+ success range (4+R) system. This system aims to be a simple and general way to play any type of RPG, with a particular focus on play-by-post (PbP) gaming. The idea is to provide simplified and minimal rules that allow to keep the game flowing at a good narrative pace, while guaranteeing logical character development. This is a free-form, 2d6 skill-based system, and should be flexible and adaptable enough to allow any idea and material from any other source to be used.

### 1. Character

#### 1.1 Descriptors
*[top](#)*

**Descriptors are small sentences that define the character**, how it differs from all other people in the world and what its current status are. As such, anything that can said about the character is a descriptor. Descriptors are free-form and limited only by the setting, the player's imagination and a hint of good sense. Descriptors can be understood more easily by dividing them into meaningful groups:  
  
  > **The only descriptor required at the start of the game is the concept**. The concept is a short two or three word description that summarises the character. *For example, you can consider the common race/class/specialization as a starting point (Elf, Wizard, Illusion) and add adjectives to a background (Educated, Charming, Noble) to create the concept of Educated and Charming Elven Noble Illusionist*. The concept is the default descriptor that ties all other descriptors together, defining what is allowed of each character.  
  
  > **Traits** reflect any permanent characteristic of the character. It includes both positive and negative inheritable racial features, particular cultural or professional skills and any noticeable physical or personality trait. The traits must be derived from the concept and can be created on the fly by calling on the concept: if it fits the concept, then it can be added to the character. *Continuing from the previous example, elven racial traits could be magical attunement and nimble, from a culture that promotes arts and craft, being a wizard it would have a professional trait of spell-casting, alchemy and arcane understanding, physically beautiful but with a burned scar covering most of his body from a alchemical accident and the character's personality would be well mannered and charming, but slightly arrogant and impatient.  
<details><summary><i>More trait examples</i></summary>
  The following examples are simple descriptors. Players should try to elaborate further their own descriptors: <br><br>
  Racial: Tough, Magic resistance, Flexible, Nimble, Fire Breath, Poison resistance, Shape-shifter, Clockwork, Mind-reader, etc. <br>
  Cultural: Stone cutting, Magic training, Warmongering, Loyalty, Merchant, Spacefarer, etc. <br>
  Professional: Druid, Thief, Spy, Medic, Hacker, Pilot, Necromancer, etc. <br>
  Physical: Beautiful, Outlandish, Scared, Blind, Weak, Badly dressed, etc. <br>
  Personality: Easy going, Aggressive, Well mannered, Vengeful, Stoic, Naysayer, Submissive, etc. <br>
</details>  
  
  > **Skills** are the general adventuring actions a character may attempt to do. Skills include anything that is not a character specific action. As such, skills are every possible action that can fail and be improved, from using weapons and armour to interacting with other creatures and objects. To define the character skills, think what sort of actions the characters will be doing during the adventure. As for traits, skills can be created on the fly, but some more advanced or specialised skills may be forbidden for some characters, if previous training cannot be justified by the character's concept. *As an illusionist, relevant skills would be, invisibility, create sound, create image, distract and fast talk*. For a simpler character creation, refer to the skills examples below.

  </blockquote>
  Select 2 skills from each of the following blocks. You are allows to switch from one block to another, to a maximum of 4 skills per block. Set all the chosen skills to level 1.<br>  
</details>  
  
  > **Abilities** represent any particular action that the character has mastered, a signature move or a personalised take on a regular skill. Abilities add an extra twist the character's skill and provide the opportunity to add special effects to an action. *Fast talking is important for an illusionist to keep the audience both engaged and distracted, it is a deception skill that can have the added effect of confusing the target. Thus the character has the ability Words of Confusion*. Characters may start with one ability.
<details><summary><i>Examples for abilities</i></summary>
  Counter attack: counter attack on successful defence. <br>
  Freezing Bolt: add freezing effect to a ice spell. <br>
  Fire Ball: add shape to a fire spell. <br>
  Noble Families: add knowledge of Noble lineages. <br>
  Magic Brawling: add magic effect to unarmed attacks <br>
  Aim: Make ranged attacks more precise. <br>
  Optimization: Calculate the optimal strategy to outmanoeuvre the enemy.<br>
</details>  
  
  > **Conditions** reflect unusual effects the character acquired during adventuring, a specific change to the character's state. Conditions may be temporary, curable or permanent depending on their severity and how they were acquired. *A character fails of a cliff and brakes is leg. It is decided that the broken leg condition can be healed, but the medical intervention. If the intervention is successful, the broken leg condition is now temporary, and requires only some time and rest to be removed. However, if the medical treatment is provided by someone unskilled, it may need to a permanent injury.*
<details><summary><i>Examples for conditions</i></summary>
  Poisoned: The character is physically ill and weak. <br>
  Paralysed: The character cannot move or act. <br>
  Asleep: The character is unaware of his surroundings. <br>
  Silenced: The character cannot produce meaningful words and sounds. <br>
  Hidden: The character cannot be seen.<br>
  Optimal position: The character as an advantage on the target due to his positioning.<br>
  </details>  
  
   

#### 1.2 Progression

In this system, characters do not level up or gain quanta of power at certain points in a deterministic way. They age and gain experience as one does! Characters can progress, or improve, in 3 different ways: gain experience with skills, acquire better [equipment](other.md#32-equipment) and learn new abilities. Skills (and abilities) level up using a “learn by doing” system, matching the intended skills’ fluid dynamics and flexibility:  
  
  1. Every time you roll a 2d6 for a skill check, if the result is a double (same value on both dice) you level up that skill if the value shown (twice) is above your *current skill level plus skill tier*. 
  2. *When you reach level 4 of a skill*, you upgrade your skill to a higher tier.
  3. *Once you reach the maximum level of a skill* (level up with a double 6), add a permanent +1 bonus to the same skill on the next tier.
  
**Upgrading**: While the skill level represents how successful the character is using the skill, the skill tier reflects advances in the power, specificity, methodology and deeper understanding of the skill. Higher power and more advanced methods are more difficult to handle. When upgrading a skill tier, you gain:  
  
  1. Training (+1 level) on another skill of the current tier.   
    
  2. A new level 0 (tier 0) ability attached to your skill. These abilities should provide special effects on top of the base skill.   
  <details><summary>3. A higher tier version of the same skill at level 0 (but you maintain the previous skill!)</summary>
  <i>For example a character with the Use Poisons skills at tier 0 and level 3 rolls double 4s. As such, the character upgrades the skill from Use Poisons (3) to Use Poisons (4:0). This notation shows the level of the skill for each tiers unlocked. Since higher tiers reflect the use of stronger poisons and the different safety methods associated with handling them, the player may use the skill at tier 0 level 4 or at tier 1 level 0 depending on the situation.</i> 
  </details><br>
<details><summary><b>Training</b>: Characters can only use skills that reflect their concept and background. As such, all characters are considered untrained in all unsuitable skills unless agreed otherwise. All characters are allowed to train and study to unlock skills as fitting to the story and game setting. </summary>
  <i>An uneducated tribal warrior may automatically fail magic/technological skills and some "civilised" knowledge (dynastic succession rules) and social skills (court etiquette) for example</i> 
  </details>  

#### 1.3 Equipment

<details><summary>As skills, equipment is free-form and can be defined *on the fly*. To create a new piece of equipment or item, simply name it by defining it and adding an adjective to the base name.</summary>
<i>Rusting Sword, Long Rope, Fast Horse, Long-ranged Rifle, Heavy Armour, Amazing Laser Blaster. </i></details>
<details><summary>To that, a small extra descriptor may be added if the equipment has any distinctive feature or power</summary>
<i> Compare useless robes with useless robes of might.</i></details>
Of course, super cool and legendary items can have names that are a reference to some historical or mythical place, event or person, and can be uses as opportunities for flashback chapters or as part of their character arcs.


Like skills, equipment is a way to further improve the character. Take the the following 3 ways as an example:  
<blockquote>
<details><summary><b>Apply a bonus to a skill or, more rarely, speciality</b>: There aren't really many statistics that can be affected by equipment. Equipment that provides bonus will be noted as +1/L:T (the casual penalty as -1/L:T), where +1 is the provided bonus (-1 the penalty), L the maximum level obtainable with equipment.</summary>
<i>A cheap stick is +1/1:0, meaning that players get a +1 bonus on their stick (spear/staff?) skill as long as this bonus does not result in a modifier greater than of 1 on a tier 0 skill, so the equipment has no effect for players with stick skill at level 1.<br> 
Likewise, a Balanced sword could be +1/3:2, which provides a bonus for players below sword level 3 up to tier 2. This means that you may be too skilful to actually gain any bonus from your equipment.</i></details>
<details><summary><b>The item has a descriptor which can be called:</b> This allows for more general powers or effects to be imbued in the equipment. Using descriptors allows for more flexibility in equipment creation. </summary>
<i>A poisoned dagger has poison descriptor, which can be called 3 times to induce poison on a target. <br>
A scroll of thunder has a thunder spell descriptor that can be called to use the thunder spell at the specified level. <br>
A helmet of speed has the fast descriptor, which is called to add another action to the player's turn. <br>
A hammer has the stun effect, which can be called to hit harder when out-manoeuvring an enemy.<br>
A mantle of rose scent may let you automatically convince blind creatures you're a talking rose</i></details>
<details><summary><b>Item may be used to protect the characters</b>: Particularly true for armour and magical items, these items can either reduce the wound/stress counters or prevent damage. </summary>
<i>A full plate armour may absorb the first 3 wound counters while fully repaired<br>
A magical amulet may provide immunity to fire damage twice before re-charging<br>
A magical helmet may whisper encouraging words, reducing the amount stress counters gained by 1</i></details>
<details><summary>In some settings, <b>items may be required in order to use certain skills</b>, such as spell-casting </summary>
<i> Fhe most extreme example would be that of a level 3 water magic caster that is not be able to cast any water spells if her create water ring is not equipped. This would work as a specialization of the spell book concept, where each spell is associated with an item</i></details>
</blockquote>


### 2. Conflict

#### 2.1 Structure

This system uses turns to structure the game, where **each turn is made by a single intervention from every player**, giving the opportunity for every player to take an action if he wishes to do so. Importantly, **all actions within a turn occurs simultaneously** so there is no clear initiative or turn order. At the begging of each turn, the previous actions are resolved, the consequences described and the new situation introduced. **Conflict arises any time the outcome of a players' actions is uncertain**. As such, each conflict should reflect a specific situations matching one of the [character's specialities](characters.md#12-character-specialities). 

<details><summary>All conflicts are solved with a narrative, <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/355-how-to-run-combat-in-the-theater-of-the-mind" target="_blank">theatre of the mind</a> approach, where the results from the previous turn inform on the behaviour of the NPCs on the next turn.</summary>
  <i>This is to say that, for example, a dragon does not have to be bashed to a pulp of negative HP to be defeated. Its actions are determined by the number of successes and failures the players accumulated during the conflict, where each success reflect a new action, approach or consideration noticeable by the players.</i></details>

Scenes in this system are not defined by one player only. Even though one player take the role of game master (GM), all players should have the opportunity to take control and make their own scenes, and contributing the other player's scenes:  
  
  1) Since the skill check result is immediate, the player is allowed to interpret the result of his own action. The next player can then add any interesting details that may introduce his own actions. As such, to players are allowed to interpret any single skill check. Once all players acted, the scene owner then reinterprets the entire turn taking into account the players suggestions.

  2) After introducing any new scene, place or situation, the players should add a detail to the scene. Players have the opportunity to contribute to the scene, from just adding new descriptive details to bring out different things about the places they visit, from adding a character or hinting on something that could be happening soon.

  3) This small hints and details will contribute to the player's change to play a card and take over the game. At the beginning of the game, each player picks 3 cards. Each player will then be able to add rumours, hints and clues to the story, trying to drive players into their secret story arc. Once other players take the bait, the player can play one card and discard the other 2, starting a his own scene *(that is, that player becomes the GM)*. The player can then move the character secret story arc forward, that is, players will GM their own character's arc! Whenever a new player takes over, the previous scene owner picks 3 new cards.

___
**Card suits**: Each suit reflects a different type of quest or game-play:  
  
  * Hearts are for socializers, so these should include a relevant amount of interaction with NPCs (chatty enemies, distressed peasants, negotiating passage). 
  * Diamonds are for achievers, so these include or point to some clear reward or something the players can achieve or collect (rare equipment sets, money, status). 
  * Spades are for explorers, so these should introduce new lands, explain long lost secrets or clarify some historical event or any other discovery (background information, a rumours of distant lands, a secret revealed by an solving a puzzle). 
  * Clubs are for killers, so these quests should should be filled with combat and fights (challenges of power, all out combat, arenas)

**Card values**: The numeric values of the cards illustrate the challenge of the conflict, so cards with higher values will present more danger to the players (be it the number of enemies, successes required, total enemy tier, situational penalties, having the players surprised, etc.). Royals will represent important named enemies (possibly recurring enemies). A Joker is a quest that has a change to gain a bless or new ability or in some way provide a significant improvement *(being knighted by the king could be as important as a new ability!)* while Aces represent conflicts leading to new friendly or helpful connection.
    

#### 2.2 Actions

During conflict, **each player is allowed to move and choose one other actions each turn** with a potential defence action being called if the character is attacked. Actions are free-form and if the player comes up with an idea, that should be implemented within reason. As such, **each player calls for an action by describing it and its intentions.** Basic actions include:

  > **Move action**: cover 1 "space" of movement.  
  > **Attack action**: actively attempt to damage a target's position (either with sword or word!)  
  > **Defence action**: protect from an adversary's attack or insult (dodge, shield, rebuke, etc.)  
  > **Manoeuvre action**: try to impose a disadvantage on a target (disarm, hide, gain terrain advantage, etc.)  
  > **Interact action**: interact with items, be it picking them from the floor or from a bag, reloading a weapon or drinking a potion, etc.  
  > **Recover action**: recover from a previous attack or simply fall back to overview the battle field or catch some breath.

*Note that* each actions called should correspond to a skill (or ability). If an action requires a non-existent skill, simply add it to the list at level 0. If it wasn't there to start with, it is fair to assume the characters have no experience with it. However, consider the character's background and, if it would be reasonable for the character to have some experience in the skill, allow it to start at level 2.

___

**Stances**: However, given the limited scope of these basic actions, the players may attempt to take a stance, adding more strategic options to the conflice. Stances reflect how the character is currently approaching conflict. Based on the intended approach, the player can call a stance [effect](#24-conflict-effects) to: 
  
<details><summary>Gamble an action for additional bonus.</summary>
  <i>An aggressive player may wish to gamble away the defence action to attempt a new attack, depending on the first attack being successful, or a fighter may gamble away his success changes in order to attack an extra target by attacking twice with a -1 level penalty.</i></details>
<details><summary>Shifting bonus and penalties to improve a specific action. </summary>
  <i>A defensive character may wish to take a +1 defensive bonus in exchange for a -1 attack bonus or a manoeuvring character may put his efforts on outsmarting the target for a +1 manoeuvre bonus and the cost of a -1 defence penalty.</i><br></details>
<br>
  
**Movement**: In this system, there are no grids, maps or any other sort of objective locations and positions during conflicts. The general layout is described, highlighting particularities that could be used for or against the players and all characters involved will start in relative positions to each other. Each character can be:  
  
  > **Close**: Can be attacked normally with melee weapons, but with a -1 stress penalty for ranged weapons and magic. If hit once, ranged attackers (including spell-casters) will be forced into a defensive position and see their attack disrupted.  
  > **Nearby**: Enemies can be attacked with melee weapons (after moving), long reach weapons, ranged weapons and magic.  
  > **In range**: Enemies can be attacked with ranged weapons and magic.  
  > **Out of reach**: Enemies can be attacked only with higher powered magic (count as +1 tier enemy).

*Note that* these positions are not linearly spaced. Because all positions are relative to the players, all players occupy the close space at all times and need to move 1 "space" to a *nearby* position, 2 "spaces" to get to an *in range* target or 4 "spaces" to reach an *out of reach* target. 

#### 2.3 Resolution



<details><summary>When a player wants to do an action, the player calls on it and describes the intended effect. If the action's result is uncertain, then the character is in a conflict situation. To resolve the conflict, the character must name a relevant skill to check for the action's success.</summary>
<i>A player wants to climb a steep wall to sneak into the Baron's private garden. Given the height of the wall, the result of this action is uncertain and a conflict is started. The player can then choose from any reasonable skills, such as climb or jump, and make a skill check to find out what happens</i></details>

**Success range**: To determine if an action is successful, roll a 2d6 and sum the result. If that result is contained by the success range, that is, it is one of the success numbers, then the action is successful. The success range root value is 5 and how far it extends, depends on the applicable modifiers:  
  
<details><summary>A positive modifier <b>adds numbers above 5</b> to the success range, one number per each +1 in the modifier. This means that the success range will be all numbers between 5 and 5 + modifier (both included).</summary>
<i>If it is determined that the character has a modifier of +3 for the climb skill, then the success range will have the root 5 and 3 more values: 6,7 and 8. Success will occur if the rolled sum is one of those 4 values. Note that the success range is from 5 to 5+3.</i></details>
<details><summary>A negative modifier <b>moves the root below 5</b>, one value for each -1 in the modifier.</summary>
<i>Another character tries to follow and has the modifier of -2. This means that the success root will be moved down twice, that is from 5 to 3. Success in this case will only occurs if the rolled sum is 3.</i></details>  
  
> *The success range, even though simple, is a fairly strange concept for many players and may take a while to get used to.* An alternative method can be derived by subtracting 5 to the result. Given that the success range from 5 to 5+modifier, rolling 2d6-5 will mean that the success range is now from 5-5 to 5-5+modifier, that is from 0 to the modifier. The result is converted to a *roll less than the modifier* type of system for positive modifiers or *roll equal to modifier* for negative modifiers.

**Modifiers**: The modifier that defines the success range is the sum of all bonuses and penalties that apply to the skill being checked, including:

<details><summary><i>The Skill level</i>: The skill level is added as a bonus for the action.</summary>
<i>A character with a skill level 4 adds a bonus of +4 to the modifier</i></details>
  
<details><summary><i>The Speciality value</i>: Each type of conflict reflects a situation that should be covered by one of the specialities.</summary>
<i>Note that this implies that the same skill can have very different success rates depending on the situation. For example, a character with a sword skill of 3 and Brawl speciality of +1 and Mingle speciality of -1 will have a modifier of 4 when trying to cut down a goblin, but only a modifier of 2 if showing off his sword skills to someone. This can be interpreted as the character being awkward handling his sword, but it still cuts when it hits a goblin!</i></details>

<details><summary><i>Situational</i> +1 bonuses and -1 penalties may be applied depending on conditions affecting the character or to particular action difficulties.</summary>
<i>If the character gets into a tavern brawl with drunk clients, then maybe it is easier to dodge and a +1 bonus is applied. Dodging a goblin's sword is a normal effort, so no change is applied, but dodging a giant's sweeping club, is probably more difficult, providing a -1 penalty.</i></details>

<details><summary><i>Fatigue</i>: Each time a skill is used and a 6 is rolled in either die, a cumulative -1 fatigue penalty is added to the skill, preventing the character from constantly using the same skill.</summary>
<i>If a character with the climb skill level 3 continuous to climb a mountain, he will risk becoming fatigued. For example, the player rolls a 6, getting a -1 penalty on the climbing skill. If the player was to roll another 6, the character would have accumulated a -2 fatigue penalty.</i></details>
<br>
<details><summary><b>Abilities</b>: Abilities work a bit differently than skills because they represent a special use of a given skill. As such, if an ability succeeds, the additional effect occurs, while if it fails, the roll defaults to the original skill with a drawback effect. </summary>
<i>A character attempts to use its Iaijutsu counter ability level 2 attached to his sword skill level 4 and rolls a 9. The ability will fail but the base sword skill still succeeds! This means that the character will not be able to counter-attack (ability effect) but it will strike its target (sword skill) as the ability check defaults to the attached skill. However this comes with a drawback, for example, failing its Iaijutsu sets the character off-balance and it will have a -1 defence penalty, regardless of the result of the base sword skill. </i></details>
<br>


**Failure handling**: If a character succeeds, them the action is completed as intended. However, there are many ways of failing. The most important thing to keep in mind is that failure should keep the story flowing instead of bringing it to a halt, leaving the players with no options or just delaying the inevitable by allowing infinite re-rolls. Failure handling should assume that given time and resources, the players will not fail unless something happens. From this follows that failure is an opportunity to add complications, twist and new developments to the story that the players need to consider. So, instead of simply failing, the players can call on their failed descriptor to handle the action. Consider the following failure effects:  
  
<details><summary><i>The action is time-sensitive</i>: Failing allows a limited number of repetitions, gradually increasing the tension with each failure.  </summary>
<i>A tyrant lord is about to execute the hostages, one by one. As infiltrated agents, the players try to convince him that sparing the prisoners would be wiser, because the princess they want to rescue is the fourth hostage in the line of execution. Each failure will result in another slain hostage.</i></details>

<details><summary><i>The action is interrupted</i>: Failing once prevents the action from being repeated because something else happened, not because the player isn't skilled enough to do it.  </summary>
<i>The player tries to jump over a wagon to get a clear shot at the tyrant lord, however, the wagon's owner shows up and starts to chat about the on-going public execution with the player.</i></details>  

<details><summary><i>The action succeeds anyway</i>: Fail forward is an interesting concept that allows the player to succeed even if they fail, but with an added twist or complication. It is similar to having the action interrupted, but it allows for the player to get what he wants.  </summary>
<i>As the player is looking for the incriminating secret papers in the tyrant lord's office, even though the player manages to identify and take them, the paper weight that was on the table is dropped, making a very noticeable noise. </i></details>

<details><summary><i>Forced success</i>: When a player fails an action, it can be converted to a success by pushing the character to its limits.  </summary>
<i>1) In dire circunstances, the players may be allowed to succed, but rolling a 2d6 and taking the lowest value as wounds or frustration, whichever makes the most narrative sense. <br> 
  2) On the other hand, some skills don't make sense failing, like buffing magic on a willing target. Failing, in such cases can be hanlded as forced success and reduced the effect frok the highest values rolled to the lowest.
  3) Failing could also add descriptors and penalties to the character as required or simply inform the narrative.</i></details>
<br>

<details><summary><u>Narration effects</u>: To keep thinks more interesting, when a 1 is rolled in any dice, a narrative effect may be called. This effect is call to add a *but* to the action resolution, attenuating the results of the action.
