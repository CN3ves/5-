Welcome to my little page for developing and testing the 5+ system. This system aims to be a simple and general way to play any type of RPG, with a particular focus on play-by-post (PbP) gaming. The idea is to provide simplified and minimal rules that allow to keep the game flowing at a good narrative pace, while guaranteeing  logical character development. This is a free-form, 2d6 skill-based system, and should be flexible and adaptable enough to allow anything to be used or done, as long as it is reasonable within the game's setting.

**Quick rules**:

*Call action*:  
&nbsp; 1) Create a character concept you want to play with 2 or 3 abilities or traits.  
&nbsp; 2) The turn is introduced by the scene owner.  
&nbsp; 3) You can move, do something and defend yourself.  
&nbsp; 4) Whenever you want to do something, describe your intentions, roll a 2d6 and name a suitable skill.  

*Skill check*  
&nbsp; 5) Calculate your skill modifier by summing your speciality, your skill level and any situational bonus or descriptor effect. Subtract your skill fatigue from that value.  
&nbsp; 6) If you modifier is positive and sum of your 2d6 roll is within the range of 5 and 5 + modifier (including both), you succeed.  
&nbsp; 7) If you modifier is negative and sum of your 2d6 roll is 5 - modifier, you succeed.  
&nbsp; 8) If you rolled a 1 in any of the dice, use that to add a "but" twist to your result.  

*Failure*  
&nbsp; 9) If you fail, keep the lowest die.  
&nbsp; 10). If you failed, try to handle it creatively. Failing does not have to mean failing!  
&nbsp; 11). If you failed and may take damage as consequence, add 1 wound counter. If the number of counters is above the value of the kept die, you gain one level of wounds.  
&nbsp; 12). If you failed an action you started, add 1 stress counter. If the number of counters is above the value of the kept die, you gain one level of stress.  
  
*Level up*  
&nbsp; 13). If you rolled a double and the value repeated value is above the level of the skill you're using, level up the skill.  
&nbsp; 14). If your skill level is now 4, upgrade the skill to a new tier, gain one level on any other skill and learn an ability.  
&nbsp; 15). If your skill levels up with a double 6 (maximum level), you gain a +1 bonus to the next tier of that skill.  
  
*Resolve turn*  
&nbsp; 16). The actions of all intervening characters, both playable (PC) and non-playable (NPC) are described based on the results and a new turn is started.
