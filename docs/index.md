Welcome to my little page for developing and testing the 5+ success range system. This system aims to be a simple and general way to play any type of RPG, with a particular focus on play-by-post (PbP) gaming. The idea is to provide simplified and minimal rules that allow to keep the game flowing at a good narrative pace, while guaranteeing logical character development. This is a free-form, 2d6 skill-based system, and should be flexible and adaptable enough to allow any idea and material from any other source to be used.

### 1.1 Descriptors
*[top]()*

**Descriptors are small, clear sentences that define the character**, how it differs from all other people in the world and what its current status is. As such, anything that can said about the character is a descriptor. Descriptors are free-form and limited only by the setting, the player's imagination and a hint of good sense. Descriptors may be static or ranked (may be levelled up), temporary or permanent. For example, some meaningful descriptor groups would include:  
  
  * **The only descriptor required at the start of the game is the concept**. The concept is a short description that summarises the character. It is a permanent static default descriptor that ties all other descriptors, defining what is allowed for each character.  
  > *For example, you can consider the common race/class/specialization as a starting point (Elf, Wizard, Illusion) and add adjectives and a background (Educated, Charming, Noble) to create the concept of Educated and Charming Elven Noble Illusionist*.
  
  * **Traits** reflect any permanent and static physical or mental characteristic of the character and should be both positive and negative (that is, try to add a but to a positive trait whenever it makes sense). Examples of traits would include inheritable racial features, particular cultural or professional/training skills and any noticeable physical or personality features.  Trait may be gained or lost during an adventure, but may not be levelled up. Based on their character concept, players should consider how they want to play their character and what traits it should have. As such traits should be derived from the concept and can be created on the fly by calling on the concept: if it fits the concept, then it can be added to the character.
  > Continuing from the previous example, elven racial traits could be magical attunement but feeble, from a culture that promotes arts and craft, being a wizard it would have a professional trait of spell-casting, alchemy and arcane understanding, but no formal combat training, physically beautiful but with a burned scar covering most of his body from a alchemical accident and the character's personality would be well mannered and charming, but slightly arrogant and impatient.  
<details><summary><i>More trait examples</i></summary>
  <i>The following examples are simple trait descriptors. Players should try to elaborate further their own descriptors, particularly how and when they can be an advantage or a disadvantage. Note that traits could work as a non-quantitative generalization of other systems "attributes". <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Racial:</u> Tough, Magic resistance, Flexible, Nimble, Fire Breath, Poison resistance, Shape-shifter, Clockwork, Mind-reader, etc. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Cultural:</u> Stone cutting, Magic training, Warmongering, Loyalty, Merchant, Spacefarer, etc. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Professional:</u> Druid, Thief, Spy, Medic, Hacker, Pilot, Necromancer, etc. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Physical:</u> Beautiful, Outlandish, Scared, Blind, Weak, Badly dressed, etc. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Personality:</u> Easy going, Aggressive, Well mannered, Vengeful, Stoic, Naysayer, Submissive, etc.</i>
  <br>&nbsp;
</details>  
  
  * **Skills** are the general adventuring actions a character may attempt to do. Skills include anything that is not a character specific action. As such, skills correspond every possible action that can fail and be improved, from using weapons and armour to interacting with other creatures and objects. As suck, skills are ranked descriptors. To define the character skills, think what sort of actions the characters will be doing during the adventure. Similarly to traits, skills can be created on the fly, but some more advanced or specialised skills may be forbidden for some characters, if previous training cannot be justified by the character's concept. 
  > *For an illusionist, relevant skills could be, invisibility, create sound, create image, distract and fast talk. However, the character has no formal combat training and cannot use weapons and armour effectively.*.

  > *A character falls of a cliff and breaks his leg. It is decided that the broken leg condition can be healed with a the medical intervention. If the intervention is successful, the broken leg condition is now temporary, and requires only some time and rest to be removed. However, if the medical treatment is provided by someone unskilled, it may results in permanent injury.*

### 1.2 Progression
*[top]()*  

In this system, characters do not level up or gain quanta of power at certain points in a deterministic way. They age and gain experience! Characters can progress (or improve) in 3 different ways: gain experience with skills, acquire better equipment and learn new abilities. 

**Skills** level up using a “learn by doing” system. Every time a skill descriptor is called and a double is rolled that is, both dice show the same value, if that value is above the skill level, it gains a new level. Every time a skill hits level 3 or more, a new **ability** related to that skill is gained. On the other hand, if a character hits the resistance point, the player will roll 2d6 at the end of the conflict. If a double is rolled, **resistance** levels up: if the value shown on the dice face is above the resistance point, increase resistance point by 1, otherwise increase the break-point by 1 if the sum of the die is greater than that of the resistance values.

As skills, **equipment** is free-form and can be defined on the fly. To quickly create a new piece of equipment or an item, simply name it by defining it and adding an adjective to the base name. To that, a small extra descriptor may be added if the equipment has any distinctive feature or power. Of course, legendary items can have names that are a reference to some historical or mythical place, event or person, and can be uses as opportunities for flashback chapters or as part of character arcs. Items will have their own resistance descriptor and will lose their bonus if past the resistance point and brake if past the break-point. 
> *For example, Rusting Sword, Long Rope, Long-ranged Rifle. 
For a distinctive power, compare useless potion with useless potion of might.
Instead of the general legendary holy sword of divine power, it may be better to call it *.  

Because equipment is free-form, its uses are limited only by the players imagination. Consider the following 4 common way of using equipment:  
  
  * The item applies a bonus to a skill: Equipment that provides bonus will be noted as +1/X (the casual penalty as -1/X), where +1 is the provided bonus (-1 the penalty) and X the maximum level obtainable with equipment.
> A Cheap Stick is +1/1, meaning that players get a +1 bonus on their stick (spear/staff?) skill as long as this bonus does not result in a modifier greater than of 1, so the equipment has no effect for players with "stick" skill at level 1. Likewise, a Balanced Sword could be +1/3, which provides a bonus for players below sword level 3. This means that you may be too skilful to actually gain any bonus from your equipment.  
  * The item has a descriptor which can be called: This allows for more general powers or effects to be imbued in the equipment and allows for more flexibility in equipment creation.  
> A poisoned dagger has poison descriptor, which can be called 3 times to induce poison on a target.  
A scroll of thunder has a thunder spell descriptor that can be called to use the thunder spell at the specified level.  
A warhammer has the stun effect, which can be called to hit harder when out-manoeuvring an enemy.  
A mantle of rose scent may let you automatically convince blind creatures you're a talking rose  
  * The item may be used to protect the characters: Particularly true for armour and magical items, these items can either reduce or prevent certain types of damage, physical or mental wounds. 
> A leather plate armour may provide a +3 resistance while fully repaired, while a full plate armour may prevent damage from light weapons.  
A magical amulet may provide immunity to fire damage twice before re-charging.  
  * The item may provide access to certain skills: This will be mostly true for weapons and armour skills, as a character won't be able to use a the axe skill without an axe, but it may also be relevant for spell-casting in some settings.  
> The most extreme example would be that of a level 3 water magic caster that is not be able to cast any water spells if her create water ring is not equipped. This would work as a specialization of the spell book concept, where each spell is associated with an item and cannot be cast if the item is not active.

## 2. Conflict

### 2.1 Structure
*[top]()*  

The game is started by the Game Master (GM), which is the player that defines the overall setting and game story. However, besides this main story, each character has an individual motivation, a goal or a story to explore. To accommodate this, **the system is organized into scenes**, where each player may own any given scene. A scene is a self-contained part of a story, such as a mission or a dungeon, that the characters decided to pursue. So, even though only one player takes the role of GM at any time, the other players have the opportunity to contribute to the scene with more than their character actions, for example:
  
  > Since the skill check result can be immediately interpreted, the player performing the action is allowed to interpret the result of his own action. The next player can then add any interesting details that may introduce his own actions. As such, two players can interpret any single skill check, including adding any required details. Once all players have acted, the scene owner then reinterprets the entire turn taking into account the players suggestions.
  
  > After a new scene, place or situation is introduced, the players should add a detail to the scene by suggesting some detail their character notices. This way, all players have the opportunity to contribute to the scene, from simply adding new descriptive details and bringing out different things about the places they visit, from adding a character or hinting on something that could be happening soon.
  
To **take over the scene** a player must first build up enough information for the other players to follow one of their quests. At the beginning of the game, each player picks 3 cards. Each player will then be able to add rumours, hints and clues to the story, passively gathered from reasonable "information" sources. These small pieces of information are used to drive other players into their secret story arc. Once other players take the "bait" and decide to follow these tips, the player can play one card, starting a his own scene. Whenever a new player takes over, the previous scene owner picks 3 new cards. 
  
  > **Card suits**: The suit of the card played to take over the scene reflects the type of quest or game-play to use:  
  *Hearts are for socializers*: Include a relevant amount of interaction with NPCs (chatty enemies, distressed peasants, negotiating passage).  
  *Diamonds are for achievers*: Include or point to some clear reward or something the players can achieve or collect (rare equipment sets, money, status).  
  *Spades are for explorers*, Introduce new lands, explain long lost secrets or clarify some historical event or any other discovery (background information, a rumours of distant lands, a secret revealed by an solving a puzzle).  
  *Clubs are for killers*: Should be filled with combat and fights (challenges of power, all out combat, arenas)  
  
  > **Card values**: Two of the cards in the player's hand can be discarded to provide the scene owner with rumours at any suitable time, up to the numeric value of the card. The scene owner is then responsible for making sure the rumours get to the character's hears. Royals will represent important named enemies (possibly recurring enemies) will appear, instead of rumours, while Aces represent a new friendly or helpful connection. A Joker is an important event with far reaching implication that may change the current status quo.

Each scene is structured using turns, where **each turn is made by a single intervention from every player**. The turn structure is used in all situations, to give the opportunity for every player to take an action. At the beginning of each turn, the previous actions are resolved, the consequences described and the new situation introduced. Each players then explains how the character will respond to the new situation, with a new turn starting once all character have an intended action. Importantly, **all actions within a turn occurs simultaneously** so there is no clear initiative or turn order. As such, all actions will be resolved in the order the scene owner finds most appropriate. 

**Conflict arises any time the outcome of a players' actions is uncertain** so the result of these actions must be determined before continuing. All conflicts are solved with a 2d6 roll which informs the narrative and the behaviour of the NPCs on the next turn. It is the balance between successful and failed actions that will determine how the overall encounter proceeds. *This is to say that, for example, a dragon does not have to be bashed to a pulp of negative HP to be defeated. Its actions are determined by the number of successes and failures the players accumulated during the conflict, where a certain number of successes (or failures) reflect a new action, approach or consideration by the dragon.*

### 2.2 Actions
*[top]()*  

During conflict, **each player is allowed to move and choose one other actions each turn** with a potential defence action being called if the character is attacked. Actions are free-form and if the player comes up with an idea, that should be implemented within reason. As such, **each player must describe their intended action each turn.** Basic actions include:

  > **Move action**: cover 1 "space" of movement, stand up, tumble or any other movement skill.  
  > **Attack action**: actively attempt to damage a target's position *(either with sword or word!)*  
  > **Defence action**: protect from an adversary's attack or insult *(dodge, shield, rebuke, etc.)*  
  > **Manoeuvre action**: try to impose a disadvantage on a target *(disarm, hide, gain terrain advantage, etc.)*  
  > **Interact action**: interact with items, *be it picking them from the floor or from a bag, reloading a weapon or drinking a potion, etc.*  
  > **Fall back**: temporary removes the player from the conflict.  

*Note that* most actions called should correspond to a skill (or ability) descriptor. If an action requires a non-existent skill, simply add it to the list at level 0. If it wasn't there to start with, it is fair to assume the characters have no experience with it. However, consider the character's concept an traits and, if it would be reasonable for the character to have some experience in the skill, allow it to start at level 1.

___

**Stances**: Given the limited scope of these basic actions, the players may attempt to take a stance, adding more strategic options to the conflict. Stances reflect how the character is currently approaching conflict and result in some kind of trade-off, for example:
  * Gaining a bonus at a skill by taking a penalty on another.  
> A defensive character may wish to take a +1 defensive bonus in exchange for a -1 attack bonus or a manoeuvring character may put his efforts on outsmarting the target for a +1 manoeuvre bonus and the cost of a -1 defence penalty.
  * Sacrificing an action for the chance of repeating another.  
> An aggressive player may wish to gamble away the defence action to attempt a new attack, depending on the first attack being successful, or a hidden character my gamble away his attack to move silently even further.
  * Sacrifice the action success for an increases number of targets.  
> A fighter may gamble away his success changes in order to attack an extra target by attacking twice with a -1 skill rank penalty, or a wizard may try to split his spell between 3 targets taking a -2 skill rank penalty.
   
**Movement**: In this system, there are no grids, maps or any other sort of objective locations and positions during conflicts. The general layout is described, highlighting particularities that could be used for or against the players and all characters involved will start in relative positions to each other and they are either nearby and can be reached in melee combat or that are away and it will take two move actions to reach them. However, notice that is assumed that the characters are always moving, so each turn 1 move action is always used unless specified otherwise *(move as part of a manoeuvre or as a stance)*

#### 2.3 Resolution
*[top](#)*  

When a player wants to do an action, the player calls on it and describes the intended effect. If the action's result is uncertain, then the character is in a conflict situation. To resolve the conflict, the character must name a relevant skill to check for the action's success.   
> A player wants to climb a steep wall to sneak into the Baron's private garden. Given the height of the wall, the result of this action is uncertain and a conflict is started. The player can then choose from any reasonable skills, such as climb or jump, and make a skill check to find out what happens.

**Success range**: To determine if an action is successful, roll a 2d6 and sum the result. If that result is contained by the success range, that is, it is one of the success numbers, then the action is successful. The success range root value is 5 and how far it extends, depends on the applicable modifiers:  
  * A positive modifier adds one number (above 5) per each +1 in the modifier. This means that the success range will be all numbers between 5 and 5 + modifier (both included).  
  > If it is determined that the character has a modifier of +3 for the climb skill, then the success range will have the root 5 and 3 more values: 6,7 and 8. Success will occur if the rolled sum is one of those 4 values. Note that the success range is from 5 to 5+3.  
  * A negative modifier moves the root below 5, one value for each -1 in the modifier.  
> Another character tries to follow and has the modifier of -2. This means that the success root will be moved down twice, that is from 5 to 3. Success in this case will only occurs if the rolled sum is 3.
  
<details><summary><i>Note</i></summary><i>The success range, even though simple, is a fairly strange concept for many players and may take a while to get used to. An alternative method can be derived by subtracting 5 to the result. Given that the success range from 5 to 5+modifier, rolling 2d6-5 will mean that the success range is now from 5-5 to 5-5+modifier, that is from 0 to the modifier. The result is converted to a roll less than the modifier type of system for positive modifiers or roll equal to modifier for negative modifiers.</i><br>&nbsp;</details>

**Modifiers**: The modifier that defines the success range is the sum of all bonuses and penalties that apply to the skill being checked. To find the applicable modifier, consider:  
  
  * A default +1 bonus
  * The skill level is added as a bonus for the action.
  * Situational +1 bonuses and -1 penalties may be applied depending on conditions affecting the character or to particular action difficulties. 
> If the character gets into a tavern brawl with drunk clients, then maybe it is easier to dodge and a +1 bonus is applied. Dodging a goblin's sword is a normal effort, so no change is applied, but dodging a giant's sweeping club, is probably more difficult, providing a -1 penalty.
  * Enemy tier: Add -1 penalty for each enemy difficulty tier.
  * Fatigue penalty: For each value above the resistance value, the character takes a -1 penalty to all rolls.
   
**Raise the stakes**: In addition to simply rolling a 2d6, the player may chose to raise his stakes, that is, to re-roll one die of his choice. Raising the stakes allows the character to push himself further and change the outcome of his action at the cost of one of resistances *(by default, mental resistance)*. The stakes may be raised as many times as a player wants, and the result is the difference between successes and failures accumulated, where:  

  * 0 reflects is a normal hit
  * Positive values represent a critical hit and allow the use of one ability per extra success
  * Negative values represent a critical failure and impose a negative condition (or extra damage) on the character per extra failure.  
  
> A character that failed his initial roll, may pay the resistance cost to re-roll one die of the player's choice: if it success with the new result, the action no longer fails, however if it fails twice, it is now a critical fail and the character will gain a negative condition.  
  
> A character that has succeeded, may pay the resistance cost to re-roll one die of the player's choice: If he success, he chooses a suitable ability as a critical hit to impose an extra effect on the target.  

**Failure handling**:There are many ways of failing and the most important thing to keep in mind is that failure should keep the story flowing instead of bringing it to a halt. Failure handling should assume that given time and resources, the players will not fail unless something happens. From this follows that failure is an opportunity to add complications, twist and new developments to the story that the players need to consider. Consider the following failure effects:  

  * The action is time-sensitive: Failing allows a limited number of repetitions, gradually increasing the tension with each failure.  
> A tyrant lord is about to execute the hostages, one by one. As infiltrated agents, the players try to convince him that sparing the prisoners would be wiser, because the princess they want to rescue is the fourth hostage in the line of execution. Each failure will result in another slain hostage.  
  * The action is interrupted: Failing once prevents the action from being repeated because something else happened, not because the player isn't skilled enough to do it.  
> The player tries to jump over a wagon to get a clear shot at the tyrant lord, however, the wagon's owner shows up and starts to chat about the on-going public execution with the player.  
  * The action succeeds anyway: Fail forward is an interesting concept that allows the player to succeed even if they fail, but with an added twist or complication. It is similar to having the action interrupted, but it allows for the player to get what he wants.  
> As the player is looking for the incriminating secret papers in the tyrant lord's office, even though the player manages to identify and take them, the paper weight that was on the table is dropped, making a very noticeable noise.  
In addition, some skills don't make sense failing, like buffing magic on a willing target. Failing, in such cases can be handled by inducing a reduced the effect (switch from the highest value rolled to the lowest).
  * Help: Any time the action of a player can logically influence the results of another player's action, a +1 help bonus may be used to tip the scales in favour of success instead of failure. 
> Generally, successful actions from other players will be evoked to justify the help bonus, but other reason could be considered, such as information from knowledge skills, narrative effects or specific descriptors that may apply. 

**Narration effects**: To keep thinks more interesting, when a 1 is rolled in any dice, a narrative effect may be used by adding a *but* to the action resolution, attenuating the results of the action. So for a failed roll, the player fails but there was something positive, while for a successful roll there was a consequence unaccounted.  
> The player tries to hide before the guards come into the room. He fails to find a place to hide, but he notices an open window through which he can escape.
The player successfully spots a secret passage on the wall, but the opening mechanism seems to be stuck.

**Wounds**: Every time a character fails a defence action, it takes 1 to the matching resistance *(physical combat to physical resistance)*. If this value is greater than the resistance point, the character will gain a -1 fatigue penalty for each point above the resistance point. If the value is above the break-point, the character is unable to continue. At the end of the conflict, a 2d6 must be rolled if the resistance point was broken *(same for level up resistances)*. If any die show a value below the resistance score below current fatigue penalty, the character gains a wound descriptor.


**NPCs**

Players do all the rolling. NPCs do not roll. If a player hits the target, it's because the target didn't dodge. Likewise, if a player fails to dodge, it's because the enemy hit. The only things required to define an NPC character is:  
  
  * Its goals: *Why is the NPC opposing the players?*
> Is it a giant hungry spider trying to eating the players, an demonic spirit hoping to corrupt them or simply a vengeful adventure trying to get payback
  * Its actions and abilities 
> Can the NPC bite, smash or summon inter-dimensional demon of ultimate destruction? Maybe it will simply insult and provoke the players?*  
  *  Its combat behaviour: *How it reacts to player's accumulating successes and failures?*
> An NPC can act more fearful as the players accumulate successes or more boldly as the players fail to act.
