## 1) Introduction  
The 5+ system is a light, simple and flexible dice gaming system that can be used in various gaming contexts. 
It focuses on free-form narrative and player freedom, instead diving deep into the mechanistic details, keeping 
the story flowing at a good pace, while guaranteeing the possibility of building complex characters and their 
development, using nothing but <span style="color:green">two six-sided dice (2d6)</span>, a pencil and a notebook. Being a generic gaming system, 
it can be adapted to fit a diversity of settings, game styles, concepts and adventures. Specific options are 
included to allow the players to drive the story, distributing and decentralising of the Game Master’s task 
for a wider shared storytelling experience. The addition of a standard French-suited deck allows for easy 
single player options.  
  
The 5+ system is a descriptor-oriented system. 
This mean that <span style="color:green">descriptors</span> represent the underlying framework that can be easily adapted to accommodate 
many types of character concepts, game styles and genres. Using this framework, players can generate 
the game and setting that best suits them. Understanding descriptors, how to use them and how they 
interact is the essence of this gaming system.  
<sub><sup>[(Table of contents)](#table-of-contents)</sup></sub> 

#### Descriptors  
Descriptors are small, clear sentences that define someone or something. 
Unsurprisingly, adding descriptor together is what allows you to describe anything in your game, 
including how characters relate to other characters and how it differs from each other. 
*<span style="color:grey">For example, a character can be defined by as an explorer navigating exotic waters 
in search of new trading opportunities, which is different from the honor bound noble warrior that will 
fine the lost ship after a strong storm blew it off course.</span>*  

An important characteristic of this system is that, given the freeform nature of descriptors, 
these can be generated on the fly as required. Taken to the extreme, this could mean that no character 
creation is required to start a game!
*<span style="color:grey">Let’s assume the noble warrior meets the explorer, who shows him a new powerful 
weapon, firearms. The warrior has never seen this type of device, so he would not have the descriptor that 
allows him to use firearms.  Even though it is missing, you can quickly agree that, given time to 
train using the new weapons, the players may add this descriptor to their (fluid) descriptor list.</span>*  

Descriptors are combinations of <span style="color:green">characteristics</span>. 
To make any type of descriptor, you simply need to come up with an idea of what you want to describe 
and determine the combination that matches that best. These specific combinations can be grouped into descriptor subgroups to help generating a character and run a game. The descriptor characteristics are:  

* <span style="color:green">Effect</span>: Converts the free-form description (idea) into a mechanic effect, 
such as bonus and penalties, or describes how it interacts with other descriptors.  
* <span style="color:green">Counter</span>: Reflects accumulation of effects such as damage, 
strain and reputation and so on.  
* <span style="color:green">Level</span>:  Defines how efficient the descriptor is, reflecting the chances of 
successfully using it. Optionally, levels can also lead to more powerful effects which are measured by a tier.   

*Note:* The suggested annotation used is *descriptor name (counter/level:tier) – effects*. 
*<span style="color:grey">An intuitive example would be a general descriptor like Health (0/3:1) - Health reflects 
the general good physiological and psychological functioning of the character’s body and mind: If the damage 
accumulated to Health is above its level, the character gains a wound descriptor. The damage accumulated resets 
to 0 if the wound level below Health’s tier, otherwise, the character is incapacitated.</span>*

## 2) Descriptor Characteristics  
### 2.1) Descriptor Effects   
Effects describe interactions between descriptors, allow or prevent certain actions or even define particular roleplaying guidelines. *<span style="color:grey">These include gaining a +1 bonus to a skill of group of skills, forbid the use of magic by non-casters, simply stating that the character has thermal vision or other non default characteristic for the setting. For example, if the players are playing as underwater creatures, it is expected that that can breathe underwater, but maybe breathing air is not a given, so amphibious effect would need to be described.</span>* Descriptors with effects that not expected to change and are always successfully effective describe stable, long-term characteristics of a character or object. As such, we can define these as a subgroup: <span style="color:green">traits</span>. This way, traits may include what is commonly thought of as ability scores, race, class, job or training. It additionally includes any physical and mental characteristics, personality, flaws, strengths, fears, background and even culture. Generally, they should describe defining features that distinguish the character or object. *<span style=“color:grey”> For example, a strong character may have a trait descriptor Strong - you possess strength above the average person: you gain +1 bonus to non-combat actions involving strength. Even though being strong may not be a rare trait, it distinguishes the character of the average person. Another example would be the trait Moldable – the shape of this object can be changed easily, which distinguish it from most other object which have defined, unchangeable shapes (unless they break!)</span>*   
<sub><sup>[(Table of contents)](#table-of-contents)</sup></sub>  

### 2.2) Descriptor Counter   
Counter are used to measure or count, keeping track of relevant numbers associated with the descriptors. The simplest example of such descriptors would be the subgroup <span style="color:green">resistances</span>. In the case of these descriptions, the counter can be interpreted as accumulated damage. Many facets of the character’s resistances can be captured the creation of appropriate resistances. *<span style="color:grey">The most obvious resistances is the physical resistance, which would be measure how much physical damage a character has taken, for example, during a combat. However, a spellcaster may strain his mind and accumulate mental damage while characters that push their limits may accumulate fatigue. Other examples would be fear and sanity, or even magic resistance!</span>* However, damage is not the only thing that can be counted. Amongst others, <span style="color:green">attitudes</span> or <span style="color:green">reputations</span> are other examples of measurable descriptors that can be relevant to use. In these cases, the counter may be thought beyond the damage concept, instead reflecting as accumulated social standing or reputation. *<span style="color:grey">A character may gain reputation in a new region by helping villagers fight raiders, who will spread the word of his deeds, or may reduce its reputation by suspect of stealing a sacred artifact. Interestingly, one action may reduce one reputation descriptor but decrease another.</span>*   
<sub><sup>[(Table of contents)](#table-of-contents)</sup></sub> 
  
### 2.3) Descriptor Level  
Levels describe the proficiency of the character for a given action. This means that it determines the success chances of a character successfully doing something. If there is a change of success, then it means descriptors with levels are those which effects are uncertain and may fail. *<span style="color:grey">A clan's warrior may be trying to pacify a nervous horse to build up his reputation with the clan nobles. Even though the warrior is highly trained handling horses, he may still not succeed in this particular case. The result of this action will depend on the past experiences of the warrior.</span>* Given that a descriptor level correlates with a character’s experience, it may be important that these descriptors can be improved. Descriptors with levels that can also be improved can defined the subgroup of <span style="color:green">skills</span>. As such, skills represent the general adventuring actions a character may attempt to do, that is, every regular action that can fail and be improved, including attack, defense and magic actions! *<span style="color:grey">For example, a warrior may have the skill descriptor Sword, which simple allows him to handle a sword and defined how skillful the character is doing so.</span>*  
<sub><sup>[(Table of contents)](#table-of-contents)</sup></sub> 

#### Tiers  
<sub><sup>[(Table of contents)](#table-of-contents)</sup></sub>  
Levels only descript the chances of using a descriptors successfully. However, the same skill can be used differently by different characters. This means that, even though two charatcer may be using the same skill with the same chances of success, one may still be trying to use a more powerful technique or method than the other. To distinguish distinctingly different methods and approaches, <span style="color:green">stiers</span> of descriptor powers can be associated to their levels, where each tier represent a noticeable increase in descriptor power. *<span style="color:grey">We can think about the difference between to spellcasters, one apprentice and one archmage. If both are trying to cast a fire spell, it is clear that the archmage will succeed casting the same spell more often than the apprentice. However, if the archmage tries to cast a more powerfull spell, his changes of summoning these mmore devastating energies may be the same as those of the aprentice casting the simplest of spells. The difference is on the power and complexity of the spell. Even though magic is a easy example to understand, this concept can be extended to everyother skill: the sword technique may be deadlier, the smithing method may be more efficient, the diplomatic approach may be more convincing, etc.</span>

### 2.4) Characters 
<sub><sup>[(Table of contents)](#table-of-contents)</sup></sub>  
Each player would have at least one character within the game. Characters are defined by their descriptors, but the character creation process depends on the theme and aim of the game and should be agreed upon at the set up. A character can be as simple as:
> **Skills**: Improvise(2:0) – you can do any action as improvisation  
> **Resistances**: Physical(0/3:0) – your resistance to physical damage. When the damage is higher than the level, you obtain a physical wound.  

This scaffold can be modified to include traits, training, a starting skill list and abilities as appropriate for the setting and starting character experience.  *<span style="color:grey">For example, skills can be futher groups into basic skill groups to ensure balanced chaartcers, such as physical, combat, social, magic, profession, knowledge, etc.</span>* Since levels define the chances of success, selecting starting descriptor levels defines the game difficulty, so you should refer to the table below:  
  
|Level|Descriptions|Chances|
|-----|------------|-------|
|  0  | Incompetent|  ~10% |
|  1  | Novice     |  ~25% |
|  2  | Trained    |  ~40% |
|  3  | Competent  |  ~50% | 
|  4  | Proficient |  ~70% |
|  5  | Specialist |  ~75% |
|  6  | Expert     |  ~80% |

The starting level selection should be done in a way that fits the players and setting best and should refelct the character's overall concept, *<span style="color:grey">for example:</span>*  
  
  * *<span style="color:grey">Fixed or negotiated: Simply assign a suitable level to descriptors</span>*  
  * *<span style="color:grey">Randomised Creation: roll 2d6 for each descriptor and keep the worse value</span>*  
  * *<span style="color:grey">Buy Points: Assign a number of points to spend on each character, with the progression cost being the same as the cummulative levels being bought.</span>*

## 3) Resolution Methods  
### 3.1) Success Range  
<sub><sup>[(Table of contents)](#table-of-contents)</sup></sub>   
The system resolutions methods depend on characteristics available for a given descriptor, so that these methods may not be callable by all descriptors. <span style="color:green">Success range</span> is the method used when an action’s result is of uncertain. As such, success ranges are called to resolve situation where descriptors with level characteristic are used. This method takes into account both the character descriptors and the challenge itself, integrating all the values that modify the chances of a given action’s success, that is all <span style="color:green">modifiers</span>, into a range of values to which the sum of a 2d6 is compared to. If this sum is within the success range, then the action succeeds as intended. However, if the sum falls outside  the action fails or is somehow incomplete.  
*<span style="color:grey">If a player rolls 3 and 4 on their 2d6 check to ride a horse fast enough, then their final result is 7. This action will success as intended if 7 is included in the success range. For example, it would success were the success range 5-7, but not 5-6.</span>*  

To estimate the success range, thus the probability an action will succeed, it is important to consider the base value of 5, which is the default value at which an untrained character succeeds an action.  Lets say then, there the base success range is 5-5 *(including the extremes)*. The upper value of this range can be extended *(hence the name 5+)* by the character’s <span style="color:green">proficiency</span>. The character proficiency is the sum of all bonuses and penalties the character’s descriptors provide. In general, these are the skill or resistance level modified by the trait or condition effects:   
  
1.	Choose any appropriate descriptor, such as a skill for an active action or a resistance for a passive, instinctive action. Subtract the damage (if available) from the level. 
2.	To that value, add all trait and condition bonuses and penalties to determine the final proficiency.
3.	In addition, <span style="color:green">challenge difficulty</span> may provide quick +1 bonus or -1 penalty adjustments to proficiency.
4.	Add the proficiency to 5 to determine the upper bound of the success range.

For longer running games, the lower value of the range may also be modified. Each challenge will have a <span style="color:green">rank</span>, reflecting the relative difference between the character skill technique and power *(tier)* and that required to overcome the challenge. These modifiers are also added to 5 to determine the success range lower bound. Unless there is a significant difference in difficulty, most challenges’ rank will be 0, meaning that the lower bound of the success range will be 5 except in rare situations.  
*<span style="color:grey"> A character trying to sneak past the castle guard is facing a challenge that requires a superior level of skill as the action occurs in plain daylight, so the challenge rank is defined as 2 (two tiers above the character). The character has two relevant descriptors: the sneak(4:1) skill and the ninja training trait (+1 bonus). The guards are on alert, since they intercepted a message and are expecting trouble (-1 situational penalty). The resulting upper bound is 5 + 4 (skill level) + 1 (training bonus) -1 (situation) = 9. The lower bound is 5 + 2 (rank) = 7. As such, the range of possible successful values is 7-9, meaning that if the sum of the 2d6 is 7, 8 or 9, the character’s action succeeds.</span>*

*Note* that, if the upper bound is below the lower bound, the range is invalid, and the character is not capable of succeeding no matter what. This means that, due to incompetence, natural toughness or magical means, the target of the action being effectively immune to the approach taken.
