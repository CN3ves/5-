Welcome to my little page for developing and testing the 5+ success range system. This system aims to be a simple and general way to play any type of RPG, with a particular focus on play-by-post (PbP) gaming. The idea is to provide simplified and minimal rules that allow to keep the game flowing at a good narrative pace, while guaranteeing logical and flexible character development. This is a free-form, 2d6 skill-based system, and should be flexible and adaptable enough to reproduce any idea or material from any other source.

## 1. Character
  
> Quick start character guidelines:  
>  1) Choose the character concept.<br>
>  2) Pick a racial, a profession, a physical and a mental trait.
>  3) Select 2 skills from each of blocks in the skill examples. You are allowed to switch from one block to another, to a maximum of 4 skills per block. Set all the chosen skills to level 2.<br>
>  4) Pick one personal starting ability (a signature move for example).
>  5) Roll 2d6 for physical, social and mental fatigue. Set the lowest number as the resistance value and the highest as the break-point.

### 1.1 Descriptors
*([top]())*
Descriptors are small, clear sentences that define the character, how it differs from all other people in the world and what its current status is. As such, anything that can be said about the character is a descriptor. Descriptors are free-form and limited only by the setting, the players' imagination and a hint of good sense. For example, some meaningful descriptor groups would include:  
  
  * **Permanent descriptors** are those that do not change. They may be gained or lost, depending on the characters' actions in the game, but these are long-term defining characteristics.  

    * *The concept* is the only descriptor required at the start of the game. The concept is a short description that summarises and defines what actions are allowed (or not) for the character. If there is a concept, there is a character!  
    > *For example, you can consider the common race/class/specialization as a starting point (Elf, Wizard, Illusion) and add adjectives and a background (Educated, Charming, Noble) to create the concept of Educated and Charming Elven Noble Illusionist*.  
  
    * *Traits* reflect any permanent and static physical or mental characteristics of the character and should be both positive and negative. As such, players should try to elaborate further their own trait descriptors, particularly by ensuring there is a downside to them. Examples of traits would include inheritable racial features, acquired cultural behaviours and any noticeable physical or personality features. Based on their character concept, players should consider how they want their character to be. If it fits the concept, then it can be added to the character.  
    > An elven racial trait could be "Magical attunement but feeble", while they may be from a culture of art lovers that put "understand artistic value over material value". Elves are "physically beautiful" but this wizard as "a burned scar" covering most of his body from a alchemical accident. The wizard is also "well mannered and charming", but "slightly arrogant and impatient".  
    
    * *Training* correspond to the actual experience, studies and learning the character has acquired based on the concept. These descriptors are used to unlock sets of skills that the character has access to, so the players should consider the sort of actions their character will be doing.  
    > A wizard would be trained in spell-casting, alchemy and have deep arcane understanding, but no formal combat training.  

  * **Ranked descriptors** are those that can use used and improved, forming the core of the levelling system. Given the requirements, all ranked descriptors are assumed to be available to every character, even if they are not explicitly listed. As such, these descriptors can be made on the fly as required to describe the character's actions. Ranked skills have a (X:Y:Z) rank notation, were each value represent a level on different power tiers.  
    > *For example, a descriptor (5:3:0) can be used at power 1 level 5, at power 2 level 3 or at power 3 level 0.*
   
    * *Skills* are the general adventuring actions a character may attempt to do. Skills include every regular action that can fail and be improved, from using weapons and armour to interacting with other creatures and objects.  
    > *For an illusionist, relevant skills could be, invisibility, create sound, create image, distract and fast talk.*

    </details>  

    * *Abilities* represent any particular action that the character has mastered, a signature move or an individual take on a regular skill. Abilities add an extra twist the character's skill and provide the opportunity to add special effects to an action, reflecting critical skill successes. Thus, abilities can be though of as advanced skills.
    > *Fast talking is important for an illusionist to keep the audience both engaged and distracted, it is a deception skill that can have the added effect of confusing the target*

      &nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Freezing Bolt:</u> add freezing effect to a ice spell. <br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Optimization:</u> Calculate the optimal strategy to outmanoeuvre the enemy.</i>
      <br>&nbsp;
    </details>  
    
    * *Resistances* are descriptors that provide ways of measuring how much a character can take. Resistances are defined by a resistance value (tier 1) and a break-point (tier 2), that is, a value until which fatigue penalties are not applied and a value at which the character is incapacitated.  
    
    <details><summary><i>Examples of resistances</i></summary>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;<i><u>Physical resistance:</u> The amount of physical damage the character can handle. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Mental resistance:</u> The amount of mental stress the character can handle. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Social resistance:</u> The amount of social pressure the character can handle. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Fire resistance:</u> The amount of fire damage and burns the character can handle. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Magic resistance:</u> the amount of magical effects the character can handle</i>
      <br>&nbsp;
    </details>  
  
  * **Temporary descriptors** are those are frequently gained and lost. These mostly correspond to *conditions* reflecting unusual character's state. Conditions may be removed after some time or they may be curable. However, some of these descriptor may be converted into permanent descriptors (*traits*) is ignored for too long.  
  > *A character falls of a cliff and breaks his leg. It is decided that the broken leg condition can be healed with a the medical intervention. If the intervention is successful, the broken leg condition requires only some time and rest to be removed. However, if the medical treatment is provided by someone unskilled, it may results in permanent injury.*
  

### 1.2 Progression
*([top]())* 
In this system, characters do not level up or gain packs of power at certain points in a deterministic way. They age and gain experience as they go along! Characters can progress (or improve) in 4 different ways: gain experience with skills and learn new abilities, acquire better equipment and improve their natural resistances.

  1. **Skills** level up using a “learn by doing” system. Every time a skill descriptor is called and a double above the skill level is rolled, that skill gains a new level. At the maximum skill level (roll double 6), a new skill tier *(higher power)* is unlocked, so skills can go on forever to suit longer campaigns.  

  2. Every time a skill hits level 3 or more, a new **ability** related to that skill is gained. However, higher tiered skills will increase the tier of the existing ability, instead of providing a new ability.  

  3. If a character hits the resistance point during the adventure (gets fatigued), the player must roll for wounds. If a double is rolled, **resistance** may levels up. If the value is above the resistance point, it increase by 1. Otherwise, if the sum of the die is greater than that of the resistance values, the break-point increases by 1.  

 4. As skills, **equipment** is free-form and can be defined on the fly. To quickly create a new piece of equipment or an item, simply name it and add an adjective to the base name. A small extra descriptor may be added if the equipment has any distinctive feature or power. Of course, legendary items can have names that are a reference to some historical or mythical place, event or person, and can be uses as opportunities for flashback chapters or as part of character arcs. Items will have their own resistance descriptor *(item state)* and will lose their bonus if past the resistance point and brake if past the break-point.  
> *For example, Rusting Sword, Long Rope, Long-ranged Rifle. 
For a distinctive power, compare useless potion with useless potion of might.
Instead of the general legendary holy sword of divine power, it may be better to call it *.  

<details><summary>Because equipment is free-form, its uses are limited only by the players imagination. Consider the following 4 common way of using equipment:</summary>
  
  1. The item applies a bonus to a skill: Equipment that provides bonus will be noted as +1/X or -1/X:T, where +1 is the provided bonus (-1 the penalty) and X the maximum modifier obtainable with the item and T the item's effective tier <i>(for longer campaigns)</i>.
  <blockquote>A Cheap Stick is +1/1:1, meaning that players get a +1 bonus on their stick (spear/staff?) skill as long as this bonus does not result in a modifier greater than of 1, so the equipment has no effect for players with "stick" skill at level 1. Likewise, a Balanced Sword could be +1/3:2, which provides a bonus for players below sword level 3 (tier 2). This means that your technique may be too good to actually gain any bonus from your equipment. </blockquote>
  2. The item has a descriptor which can be called: This allows for more general powers or effects to be imbued in the equipment and allows for more flexibility in equipment creation. 
  <blockquote>A poisoned dagger has poison descriptor, which can be called 3 times to induce poison on a target. <br>
A scroll of thunder has a thunder spell descriptor that can be called to use the thunder spell at the specified level. <br>
A warhammer has the stun effect, which can be called to hit harder when out-manoeuvring an enemy. <br>
A mantle of rose scent may let you automatically convince blind creatures you're a talking rose </blockquote>
  3. The item may be used to protect the characters: Particularly true for armour and magical items, these items can either reduce or prevent certain types of damage, physical or mental wounds.
  <blockquote>A leather plate armour may provide a +3 the resistance trait (both values) while fully repaired, while a full plate armour may prevent damage from light weapons. <br> 
A magical amulet may provide immunity to fire damage twice before re-charging. </blockquote>
  4. The item may provide access to certain skills: This will be mostly true for weapons and armour skills, as a character won't be able to use a the axe skill without an axe, but it may also be relevant for spell-casting in some settings.
  <blockquote>The most extreme example would be that of a level 3 water magic caster that is not be able to cast any water spells if her create water ring is not equipped. This would work as a specialization of the spell book concept, where each spell is associated with an item and cannot be cast if the item is not active.</blockquote></details> 


## 2. Conflict

### 2.1 Structure
*([top]())* 
The game is started by the Game Master (GM), which is the player that defines the overall setting and game story. However, besides this main story, each character has an individual motivation, a goal or a story to explore. To accommodate this, **the system is organized into scenes**, where each player may became the scene owner (SO) at any time. A scene is a self-contained part of a story, such as a mission, a dungeon or simply an encounter, that the characters are confronted with. However, even though only one player takes the role of SO at any time, the other players have the opportunity to contribute to the scene with more than their character actions, for example:
  
  > Since the skill check result can be immediately interpreted, the player performing the action is allowed to interpret the result of his own action. The next player can then add any interesting details that may introduce his own actions. As such, two players can interpret any single skill check, including adding any required details. Once all players have acted, the scene owner then reinterprets the entire turn taking into account the players suggestions.
  
  > After a new scene, place or situation is introduced, the players should add a detail to the scene by suggesting some detail their character notices. This way, all players have the opportunity to contribute to the scene, from simply adding new descriptive details and bringing out different things about the places they visit, from adding a character or hinting on something that could be happening soon.  
  
  >  When gathering information in towns, taverns or any other suitable place, the player may be allowed to add rumours, hints and clues to the story.  
  
At the beginning of the game, each player picks 3 cards. To **take over the scene** a player must play one card, discarding the others. As a scene owner, the player is allowed to add lore, locations and characters to the game, or even use previously mentioned characters or location and and integrate then into their own scenes *(The GM may rule against the SO decision to solve clear inconsistencies)*. Whenever a new player takes over, the previous scene owner picks 3 new cards. If at the end of a player's scene (quest) no card has been played (there is no SO), the GM takes back the game and continues the main story line.
  
  > **Card suits**: The suit of the card played to take over the scene reflects the type of quest or game-play to use:  
  *Hearts are for socializers*: Include a relevant amount of interaction with NPCs (chatty enemies, distressed peasants, negotiating passage).  
  *Diamonds are for achievers*: Include or point to some clear reward or something the players can achieve or collect (rare equipment sets, money, status).  
  *Spades are for explorers*, Introduce new lands, explain long lost secrets or clarify some historical event or any other discovery (background information, a rumours of distant lands, a secret revealed by an solving a puzzle).  
  *Clubs are for killers*: Should be filled with combat and fights (challenges of power, all out combat, arenas)  
  
  > **Card values**: The card numerical value defines the scene priority, so if there is a tie, the player with the highest card goes first. Non-numeric cards are lower priority. However, Royals represent an encounter with an important enemies *(possibly recurring enemies)*, while Aces represent a new friendly or helpful connection. A Joker is an important event with far reaching implication that may change the current status quo.

Each scene is structured using turns, where **each turn is made by a single intervention from every player**. The turn structure is used in all situations, to give the opportunity for every player to take an action. At the beginning of each turn, the previous actions are resolved, the consequences described and the new situation introduced. Each players then explains how the character will respond to the new situation, with a new turn starting once all character have an intended action. Importantly, **all actions within a turn occurs simultaneously** so there is no clear initiative or turn order. As such, all actions will be resolved in the order the scene owner finds most appropriate. 

**Conflict arises any time the outcome of a players' actions is uncertain** so the result of these actions must be determined before continuing. All conflicts are solved with a 2d6 roll which informs the narrative and the behaviour of the NPCs for the next turn. It is the balance between successful and failed actions that will determine how the overall encounter proceeds. *This is to say that, for example, a dragon does not have to be bashed to a pulp of negative HP to be defeated. Its actions are determined by the number of successes and failures the players accumulated during the conflict, where a certain number of successes (or failures) reflect a new action, approach or consideration by the dragon.*


### 2.2 Actions
*([top]())* 
During conflict, **each player choose one other actions each turn**. On top of these action, the character is allowed one free move action and one defence action (if the character is attacked). *As such, all players will be mostly roll 2d6 twice each conflict turn.* Actions are free-form and if the player comes up with an idea, that should be implemented within reason, even if it reacquires creating a new skill. Because of that, **each player must describe their intended action each turn.** Basic actions include:

  > **Attack action**: actively attempt to damage a target *(either with sword or word!)*  
  > **Manoeuvre action**: try to impose a disadvantage on a target *(disarm, hide, gain terrain advantage, etc.)*  
  > **Interact action**: movement actions to interact with items, *be it picking them from the floor or from a bag, reloading a weapon or drinking a potion, etc.*  
  > **Fall back**: the character attempts to temporary move away from the conflict.  
  > **Move action** (1 free): cover 1 "space" of movement, stand up, tumble or any other movement skill.  
  > **Defence action** (1 free): protect from an adversary's attack or insult *(dodge, shield, rebuke, etc.)*  

*Note that* most actions called should correspond to a skill (or ability) descriptor. If an action requires a non-existent skill, simply add it to the list at level 0. If it wasn't there to start with, it is fair to assume the characters have no experience with it. However, consider the character's concept an traits and, if it would be reasonable for the character to have some experience in the skill, allow it to start at level 1 or 2.
  
___
   
**Movement**: In this system, there are no grids, maps or any other sort of objective locations and positions during conflicts. The general layout is described, highlighting particularities that could be used for or against the players. All characters will start in relative positions to the players. To move from one zone to another, an unblocked path (may require a roll) and full turn of movement is required:  
  
  1. Nearby and can be reached in melee combat.
  2. In range and can be targeted by ranged attacks.
  3. Too far and cannot be targeted. 

*Note that* it is assumed that the characters are always moving during combat, keeping active and ready, shifting positions and generally staying on their toes. As such, 1 move action is always used each turn, unless specified otherwise.  
> *For example, an interaction action can be part of the move action. A character may wish to stop the default combat moving to focus on reloading his weapon for example. Note that skipping the default move action means the character is not as ready for quick action as the others and may gain a -1 penalty to some skills*

#### 2.3 Resolution
*([top]())* 
When a player wants to do an action, the player calls on it and describes the intended effect. If the action's result is uncertain, then the character is in a conflict situation. To resolve the conflict, the character must name a relevant skill to check for the action's success.   
> A player wants to climb a steep wall to sneak into the Baron's private garden. Given the height of the wall, the result of this action is uncertain and a conflict is started. The player can then choose from any reasonable skills, such as climb or jump, and make a skill check to find out what happens.

**Success range**: To determine if an action is successful, roll a 2d6 and sum the result. If that result is contained by the success range, that is, it is one of the success numbers, then the action is successful. The success range root value is 5 and how far it extends, depends on the applicable modifiers:  
  * A positive modifier adds one number (above 5) per each +1 in the modifier. This means that the success range will be all numbers between 5 and 5 + modifier (both included).  
  > If it is determined that the character has a modifier of +3 for the climb skill, then the success range will have the root 5 and 3 more values: 6,7 and 8 (success range is from 5 to 5+3). Success will occur if the rolled sum is one of those 4 values.  
  * A negative modifier moves the root below 5, one value for each -1 in the modifier.  
> Another character tries to follow and has the modifier of -2. This means that the success root will be moved down twice, that is from 5 to 3. Success in this case will only occurs if the rolled sum is 3.
  
**Modifiers**: The modifier that defines the success range is the sum of all bonuses and penalties that apply to the skill being checked. To find the applicable modifier, consider:  
  
  * The skill level is added as a bonus for the action.
  * Situational +1 bonuses and -1 penalties may be applied depending on conditions affecting the character or particular action difficulties. 
> If the character gets into a tavern brawl with drunk clients, then maybe it is easier to dodge and a +1 bonus is applied. Dodging a goblin's sword is a normal effort, so no change is applied, but dodging a giant's sweeping club, is probably more difficult, providing a -1 penalty.
  * Enemy tier: Add -1 penalty for each enemy tier above the skill being used *(tier immunity may be granted for skills 2 tiers below the enemy)*.
  * Fatigue penalty: For each damage value above the resistance point, the character takes a -1 fatigue penalty to all rolls.

**Success effect**: If the character is successful, there are 3 possible way to define how successful the action was (measure the damage):  
  
  * A minimum of 1 damage
  * The value of the lowest die of damage
  * The value of the highest die of damage.  

Most basic actions will cause the lowest die as damage by default. Any applicable resistance will reduce the effect one step (by default to 1 damage) but immunities by reduce it to 0. Particularly strong results or efficient skills will upgrade the result one step (by default to the highest die).  
> A player rolls 2 and 4 for a medical skill. By default, the success effect will be the lowest value, that is, he would heal 2 damage from the target's resistance descriptor. However, he is using an advanced medical procedure in an optimal setting (clean and quiet room, all equipment and well supplied) so the effect of success will the upgraded one step to the highest value, healing 4 damage instead.

**Failure handling**: There are many ways of failing and the most important thing to keep in mind is that failure should keep the story flowing instead of bringing it to a halt. Failure handling should assume that given time and resources, the players will not fail unless something happens. From this follows that failure is an opportunity to add complications, twist and new developments to the story that the players need to consider. Consider the following failure effects:  

  * The action is time-sensitive: Failing allows a limited number of repetitions, gradually increasing the tension with each failure.  
> A tyrant lord is about to execute the hostages, one by one. As infiltrated agents, the players try to convince him that sparing the prisoners would be wiser, because the princess they want to rescue is the fourth hostage in the line of execution. Each failure will result in another slain hostage.  
  * The action is interrupted: Failing once prevents the action from being repeated because something else happened, not because the player isn't skilled enough to do it.  
> The player tries to jump over a wagon to get a clear shot at the tyrant lord, however, the wagon's owner shows up and starts to chat about the on-going public execution with the player.  
  * The action succeeds anyway: Fail forward is an interesting concept that allows the player to succeed even if they fail, but with an added twist or complication. It is similar to having the action interrupted, but it allows for the player to get what he wants. 
> As the player is looking for the incriminating secret papers in the tyrant lord's office, even though the player manages to identify and take them, the paper weight that was on the table is dropped, making a very noticeable noise.  
  * Synergy and help: Any time the action of another character or a different skill can logically influence the results of a character's action, a +1 help bonus may be used to tip the scales in favour of success instead of failure. 
> Generally, successful actions from other players will be evoked to justify the help bonus, but other reason could be considered, such as information from knowledge skills, narrative effects or specific descriptors that may apply. 
  * Decrease the action effect: For some skills particularly those with a willing target, it just doesn't makes sense failing. In this cases, the skill effect may be reduced one step (generally from lowest die to 1).

__

**Raise the stakes**: In addition to simply rolling a 2d6, the player may chose to raise his stakes, that is, to re-roll one die of his choice. Raising the stakes allows the character to push himself further and change the outcome of his action at the cost of gaining 1 damage to one suitable resistances *(by default, mental resistance)*. The stakes may be raised as many times as a player wants, and the result is the difference between successes and failures accumulated, where:  

  * 0 reflects is a normal hit
  * Positive values represent a critical hit, upgrading the effect one step, impose a condition on the target or gain a +1 bonus against the target (for each extra success).
  * Negative values represent a critical failure, downgrading the effect one step, impose a negative condition io the charatcer or a -1 penalty on the character (for each extra failure).
  
> A character that failed his initial roll, may pay take resistance damage to re-roll one die: if the roll now succeeds, the action no longer fails however, if it fails twice, it is now a critical fail.   
A character that has succeeded, may take damage to its resistance to re-roll one die of the player's choice: of he success on the second roll, he chooses a suitable ability as a critical hit to impose an extra effect on the target.  

**Abilities**: Abilities are free "raises". A player may use one ability to raise his action without taking (mental) damage or needing to re-roll one die. However the effect is predefined by the descriptor and cannot be changed as a regular critical hit. Also, the ability is fatigued by the highest die and can only be reuse when the fatigue is fully restored.  
> A warrior is defending and success. The player decides to raise the stakes using the character's Counter Attack ability. The defence is a critical success now and the enemy is successfully countered. Normally, the player would have to re-roll one die and damage one resistance to attempt a counter attack.

**Stances**: Given the limited scope of these basic actions, the players may attempt to take a stance, adding more strategic options to the conflict. Stances are a special way to *raise the stakes*, reflecting different approaches to conflict. Every time a character takes a stance, the player must define a trade-off and gain one skill-specific fatigue penalty. If the character succeeds the action, it gains the bonus, otherwise it takes damage to its (mental) resistance. For example:  

  * Gaining a bonus at a skill by taking a penalty on another.  
> A manoeuvring character may put his efforts on outsmarting the target to make it trip. To gain a +1 manoeuvre bonus the player bets a -1 defence penalty. The player pays a -1 "trip" skill fatigue penalty and, if the manoeuvring fails, the defence penalty is lifted by taking 1 to resistance.
  * Sacrificing an action for the chance of repeating another.  
> A hidden character may gamble away his attack action to gain a new move action, so he can silently sneak past a guard. The player pays a -1 "move silently" skill fatigue penalty and, if the first move works, the attack action is lost and a new silent move may be attempted. However, if the first move fails, the player may still use the attack action taking 1 damage to mental resistance.  
  * Sacrifice the action success for an increases number of targets.  
> A fighter takes a supportive stance to cover the allies' retreat and chaotically swings his sword, trying to hit multiple targets by trading its accuracy. The player may gamble away the attack success chances in order to attack an extra target by taking a "sword" skill fatigue penalty equal to the number of attacks.

**Narration effects**: To keep thinks interesting and provide continuous opportunities for small twists and turns, when a 1 is rolled in any dice, a narrative effect may be used by adding a *but* to the action resolution, attenuating the results of the action. So for a failed roll, the player fails *but* there was something happened as a consequence, while for a successful roll there was a consequence unaccounted. 
> The player tries to hide before the guards come into the room. He fails to find a place to hide, but he notices an open window through which he can escape.  
The player successfully spots a secret passage on the wall, but the opening mechanism seems to be stuck.  

Similarly, when a 6 is rolled, an *and* effect may be considering, adding an extra side effect to the action. In this case, regardless of the character success, something else happens.  
> The player tries to hide before the guards come into the room. He fails to find a place to hide and makes loud noises, warning the guards for his presence.  
The player successfully spots a secret passage on the wall and the trap on it.  

**Wounds**: Every time a character fails a defence action, it takes 1 to the matching resistance *(physical combat to physical resistance or social for social conflict)*. If this value is greater than the resistance point, the character will gain a -1 fatigue penalty for each point above the resistance point. If the value is above the break-point, the character is unable to continue. At the end of the conflict, a 2d6 must be rolled if the resistance point was broken *(same roll for level up resistances)*. If any die shows a value the below current fatigue penalty, the character gains a wound (physical, mental, social) condition. 

The damage accumulated to the resistances (or skill fatigue) counts as a automatically succeeding action if a suitable rest if taken, restoring 1 damage per restful time *(think about 1h of chilling out)*. A proper relaxation, such as a good meal, bath or long term rest. upgrade the effect one step, requiring a 2d6 roll and restoring damage by the lowest value. A full comfortable night of sleep will upgrade the effect one step further, also requiring a 2d6 roll but restoring the highest value.

**NPCs**

Players do all the rolling. NPCs do not roll. If a player hits the target, it's because the target didn't dodge. Likewise, if a player fails to dodge, it's because the enemy hit. The only things required to define an NPC character is:  
  
  * Its goals: *Why is the NPC opposing the players?*
> Is it a giant hungry spider trying to eating the players, an demonic spirit hoping to corrupt them or simply a vengeful adventure trying to get payback
  * Its actions and abilities 
> Can the NPC bite, smash or summon inter-dimensional demon of ultimate destruction? Maybe it will simply insult and provoke the players?*  
  * Its combat behaviour: *How it reacts to player's accumulating successes and failures?*
> An NPC can act more fearful as the players accumulate successes or more boldly as the players fail to act.
