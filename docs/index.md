Welcome to my little page for a PbP system developing and testing :)  
  
  
This system aims to be a simple and general way to play any type of RPG, with a particular focus on play-by-post (PbP) gaming. As such, the idea is to provide simplified rules that allow to keep the game flowing at a good narrative pace. This is a free-form, 2d6 skill-based system, so it allows anything to be used or done with the same dice roll, as long as it is reasonable within the game's setting.

**Quick rules**:

*Call action*:
  1. Create a charatcer concept you want to play with 2 or 3 abilites or traits.
  2. The turn is introduced by the scene owner.
  3. You can move, do something and defend yourselvee. 
  4. Whenerver you want to do something, describe your intentions, roll a 2d6 and name a suitable skill   

*Skill check*  
  5. Calculate your skill modifier by summing your speciality, your skill level and any situational bonus or descriptor effect. Subtract your skill fatigue from that value.
  6. If you modifier is positive and sum of your 2d6 roll is within the range of 5 and 5 + modifier (including both), you succeed
  7. If you rolled a 1 in any of the 1 dice, use that to add a "but" twist to your result.
  
*Failure* 
  8. Keep the lowest die.
  9. If you failed, try to handle it creatively. Failing does not hav eto mean failing!  
  10. If you failed and may take damage, add 1 wound counter. If the number of counters is above the value of the kept die, you gain one level of wounds. 
  11. If you failed an action you started, add 1 stress counter. If the number of counters is above the value of the kept die, you gain one level of stress. 
  
*Level up*
  9. If you rolls a double, and the value is above the level of the skill you're using, level up the skill
  10. If your skill level is now 4, upgrade the skill to a new tier, gain one level on any other skill and learn an ability
  11. If your skill levels up with a double 6 (maximum level) you gain a +1 bonus to the next tier of that skill.
  
*Resolve turn*
  12. The actions of all intervening characters, both playable (PC) and non-playable (NPC) are described based on the results and a new turn started.
