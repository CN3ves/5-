Welcome to my little page for developing and testing the 4+ success range (4+R) system. This system aims to be a simple and general way to play any type of RPG, with a particular focus on play-by-post (PbP) gaming. The idea is to provide simplified and minimal rules that allow to keep the game flowing at a good narrative pace, while guaranteeing logical character development. This is a free-form, 2d6 skill-based system, and should be flexible and adaptable enough to allow any idea and material from any other source to be used.

### 1. Character

#### 1.1 Descriptors
*[top]()*

**Descriptors are small, clear sentences that define the character**, how it differs from all other people in the world and what its current status is. As such, anything that can said about the character is a descriptor. Descriptors are free-form and limited only by the setting, the player's imagination and a hint of good sense. Descriptors can be understood more easily by dividing them into meaningful groups:  
  
  * **The only descriptor required at the start of the game is the concept**. The concept is a short description that summarises the character. The concept is the default descriptor that ties all other descriptors, defining what is allowed for each character.  
  > *For example, you can consider the common race/class/specialization as a starting point (Elf, Wizard, Illusion) and add adjectives and a background (Educated, Charming, Noble) to create the concept of Educated and Charming Elven Noble Illusionist*.
  
  * **Traits** reflect any permanent characteristic of the character and can be both positive and negative. Examples of traits would include inheritable racial features, particular cultural or professional skills and any noticeable physical or personality features. The traits must be derived from the concept and can be created on the fly by calling on the concept: if it fits the concept, then it can be added to the character. 
  > Continuing from the previous example, elven racial traits could be magical attunement and nimble, from a culture that promotes arts and craft, being a wizard it would have a professional trait of spell-casting, alchemy and arcane understanding, physically beautiful but with a burned scar covering most of his body from a alchemical accident and the character's personality would be well mannered and charming, but slightly arrogant and impatient.  
<details><summary><i>More trait examples</i></summary>
  <i>The following examples are simple trait descriptors. Players should try to elaborate further their own descriptors, particularly how and when they can be an advantage or a disadvantage. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Racial:</u> Tough, Magic resistance, Flexible, Nimble, Fire Breath, Poison resistance, Shape-shifter, Clockwork, Mind-reader, etc. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Cultural:</u> Stone cutting, Magic training, Warmongering, Loyalty, Merchant, Spacefarer, etc. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Professional:</u> Druid, Thief, Spy, Medic, Hacker, Pilot, Necromancer, etc. <br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Personality:</u> Easy going, Aggressive, Well mannered, Vengeful, Stoic, Naysayer, Submissive, etc.</i>
  <br>&nbsp;

  * **Skills** are the general adventuring actions a character may attempt to do. Skills include anything that is not a character specific action. As such, skills correspond every possible action that can fail and be improved, from using weapons and armour to interacting with other creatures and objects. To define the character skills, think what sort of actions the characters will be doing during the adventure. Similarly to traits, skills can be created on the fly, but some more advanced or specialised skills may be forbidden for some characters, if previous training cannot be justified by the character's concept. For a simple selection of skills at character creation, refer to the skills examples below.  
  > *For an illusionist, relevant skills could be, invisibility, create sound, create image, distract and fast talk. However, the character has no formal combat training and cannot use weapons and armour effectively.*.
