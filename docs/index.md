This system aims to be a simple and general way to play any type of RPG, with a particular focus on play-by-post (PbP) gaming. As such, the idea is to provide simplified rules that allow to keep the game flowing at a good narrative pace. In addition, the system is free-form, so it allows anything to be used or done, as long as it is reasonable within the game's setting. The way it works is:  
  
  1. The scene is introduced and the players describe *their intentions*/
  2. The players *call on an action or an effect*.
  3. The action is resolved by rolling two six-sided dice (2d6) and sum up the values.
  4. The results of all intervening characters, both playable (PC) and non-playable (NPC) are interpreted based on the results

# Character Creation  
[top](#table-of-contents)
  
  1. **Define the character concept** using a two or three word description. *For example, you can consider the common race/class/specialization combination as a starting point (Elven Wizard of Illusion) or add adjectives to your background (Educated and Charming Noble)*. 
  2. Choose the character's general [strength and weakness](#attributes), if any. *In what type of situations would the character fell more conformable?*
  3. Think **how you wish to roleplay the character**, and what [sort of actions](#skills) you'd want it to do. *Will the character walks in the shadows, spying on his enemies? Or will it solve most problems at sword's point?*
  4. Determine if there are any **defining characteristics** that distinguishes the character. *For example, are there any inheritable racial features, or particular cultural or professional skills that may be acquired? Perhaps some personal ability gained from past experiences?*. 
  5. Consider how your character will react to the ever increasing frustration and stress of adventuring. *How does the character behave under stress or when the frustration is too just too much to handle?*

### Attributes: 
Attributes reflect the general aptitudes the character have for *specific situations* and are generally constant throughout the character's adventuring life:  

> **Combat**: Reflects an extensive battle and combat training, both psychical and mental. Influences character's effectiveness when violent interaction with other creatures.  
  
> **Social**: Reflects an extensive understanding of others' motives, desires and feelings. Influences character's effectiveness when iterating non-violently with sentient creatures.
  
> **Explore**: Reflects a particular eye for details and understanding what they mean. Influences character's effectiveness when dealing with objects and searching for out-of-place details.

**At creation**: All attributes are set to 0, reflecting an average skill for each situation. A player can choose one single attribute that his character excels (+1) at, by sacrificing another attribute (-1), indicating that the character spent more time than usual practicing one type of situation, so also less time than usual doing practicing the other.

### Skills:
If the attributes are what distinguishes the characters' broad strengths or weaknesses, skills are the fine differences that will make a character unique. Skills refer to anything a character may do *and so include every possible action*, from using weapons and armour to interact with other creatures and objects. While the attributes are a small set of limited options, the idea is to have a free and fluid skill's list, allowing skills to be made up *on the fly*. Skills measure how good the character is at doing a given action and are *defined by their level (mastery) and tier (power)*. Broadly, skills can be divided into the following groups:

> **Combat skills**: Use of weapons and armour and well as tactical evaluations *(Evade, Dodge, Sword, Feint, Use terrain, etc.)*
> **Magic/Technological skills**: Understanding the complexities of using supernatural powers or advanced technology *(Elemental magic, Shielding, Magic Resistance, Counter magic, Alien technology, etc.)*

> **Education skills**: Knowing, remembering and understanding information previously studied *( Theology, Alchemy, Metallurgy, Herbalist, Languages, etc.)*  
> **Professional skills**: Any type of skills related to a profession, background or speciality *(Impersonation, Gambling, Disguise, First Aid, Herbalism, etc.)* 

> **Social skills**: Interact with other sentient creatures to change their perception, opinions and attitudes *(Persuasion, Negotiation, Bribery, Intimidation, Rumour-Mongering, etc.)*  
> **Perception skills**: Use of senses, instinct and intuition to notice something *(Sight, Hearing, Search, Thermal Vision, Sense Motive, etc.)*  

> **Movement skills**: Use body movement, dexterity and strength in demanding or risky ways *(Swim, Climb, Contortionist, Swim, Stealth, etc.*)  
> **Manipulation skills**: Interact with, manipulate and change objects *(Use Tool, Repair, Disarm Trap, Forgery, Sabotage, etc.)*  

**At creation**: All skills start at level 0. Select a total of 3 suitable skills from each of the following groups:
  * Combat and Magic/Technological skills (+1 or -1 skill as per Combat attribute).
  * Professional and Education skills.
  * Social and Perception skills (+1 or -1 skill as per Social attribute).
  * Movement and manipulation skills (+1 or -1 skill as per Explore attribute).
Set the chosen skills to level 3. 

#### Skill progression
Because of the skills’ fluid dynamics and flexibility, a “learn by doing” levelling system is very suitable:  
  
  1. Every time you roll a 2d6 for a skill, if the result is a double (same value on both dice) you level up that skill if the rolled value is above your *current skill level plus skill tier*. 
  2. *When you reach level 4 on a skill*, you upgrade your skill to a higher tier.
  3. *Once you reach the maximum level of a skill* (level up with a double 6), you can add a non-cumulative +1 bonus to all related skills of the same tier.
  
**Skill Tiers**: While the skill level represents how successful the character is using the skill, the skill tier reflects the power of the skill. Higher power skills are more difficult to handle, even if the character is experienced with its previous uses. When upgrading a skill tier, you gain:  
  
  1. A higher tier version of the same skill *and*
  2. Training (+1 level) on related skill of the same current tier, or a new skill-related ability. *For example, when upgrading sword skill you may decide to gain training on your axe skill, since both depend on strength and similar movements, or you could instead learn an Iaijutsu ability (counter attack on defence). Similarly, when upgrading a fire spell, you can train a different magic skill or gain a new fire ability, such as fire ball (+1 target) or burning bolt (burn condition). Finally, you could learn noble lineages skill when upgrading a history knowledge, showing deeper and more specialised understanding of a given subject.*

**Training**: Some skills, such as those from the Magic/Technological group may require extensive study and training to use. These skills can be bounded by a corresponding knowledge skill, where the knowledge can both be theoretical (study) or practical (experimenting). As such, *the level of such skills is limited by the level of their knowledge*. On the other hand, it is assumed that the characters can read or practice during their travels (down-time), so Knowledge skills have the particularity that they can be levelled up passively (given appropriate justification).
