**1) Character creation**

**1.1) Character creation: Concept**
> ![#f03c15](https://placehold.it/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) 'Concept: Define your character using two or three descriptive words. This concept can be as simple as the common race/class/specialization combination'

**1.2) Character creation: Abilities**
> Racial ability: Suggest a race for your character. Any race is valid so you can play classic races, modification of these (twisted elves, gracious dwarves) or something totally new (energetic half-koalas, sentient chairs). Think what would be the most striking characteristic of your race. (As a sentient chair, you can easily hide among other furniture of similar taste, so the racial ability Hide in the Furniture would be suitable). You can add one more positive racial trait by also taking one negative racial to balance. 

> Cultural ability: Suggest a culture's, profession's or group's ability that your character acquired due to his upbringing and experience. Note that this could be a cross-race or cross-borders trait shared by many members of a region or vocation. Let's say a player wants to play a noble crusader. Nobles are all posh bastards exploiting our good proletarian comrades regardless of their origin and crusaders are all the same throughout the realms, because they have a unifying set of beliefs. A possible cultural trait related to the professional training and social class could be Knight in Shining Armour: you polish your armour so well and so often that the light reflected on it is too bright for most mortal eyes to handle. Just as for the racial ability you can add one more positive cultural trait by also taking one negative trait to balance.

> Personal ability: If the racial ability is acquired from nature and cultural ability comes from nurture, then the personal ability is the result of experience. Your personal ability is that one thing you learned due to your unique experiences. Maybe it is something from your culture, profession or training that you mastered particularly well, or maybe it is something you acquired through practicing a hobby or exploring and studying alternative methods Did you hit your head when you were a child and gained telepathic powers? Maybe you have been chosen by a greater deity and you have some holy power. Did you learn or develop a new technique as a royal guard? Maybe you learned from your great-cousin how to trick old ladies to get their fortune? Once again, you can add one more personal ability, but the second one will require a potential setback. 

> Frustration: Adventuring is a difficult, stressful and frustrating activity. How will you react under stress, when the difficulties of the adventure are too much and you can't handle the frustration of the constant struggling? This trait will determine how the character reacts when mentally overwhelmed by the stress of the adventure. 

1.3) Character creation: Stats
> Attributes: Attributes reflect the general aptitudes the character have for specific situations. These can be changed, added and removed to fit any setting or game style, but the main attributes should be simple and clear, while allowing broad character differences.
    * Combat: Reflects an extensive battle and combat training, both psychical and mental. Due to this above average training, the character gains a bonus to skills when in a combat scene that is, one involving fights and any other violent confrontations (for example casting, defending, attacking).
    * Social: Reflects an extensive understanding of others' motives, desires and feelings. Due to this above average understanding, the character gains a bonus when interacting with other sentient creatures non-violently (for example lie to a guard, calm a dog, explain to aliens you receive them in peace).
    * Explore?: Reflects a particular eye for details and understanding what they mean. Due to this above average attention, the character gains a bonus when interacting with objects (for example, searching for papers, tracking an animal, deciphering a book)
    Similarly, characters that are below average will gain a situational penalty on their skills.
By default, all attributes start at 0, which represent the average Joe, that mighty hero who excels at nothing but also is not crap at anything! However, a player can choose one single attribute that his character excels at, by sacrificing another attribute. The idea is that if a character spent more time than usual practicing something, then it stands to reason that it also spent less time than usual doing something else. For example, a mighty wizard that spent years in a room reading ancient scrolls may have grown fat and lazy and have his physical capacity reduced

>Training: A second type of attributes can be considered. The role of these attributes is to control access to specific skills and actions and to prevent untrained characters from using them. Consider which specialized skills your character is trained with and add them to your training section.
    Let's take the example of magic and casters. Because access to magic varies from setting to setting, it can be added as a training attribute. The Magic Attribute's main function is as a "gate" that controls how easy or difficult it is for any character to access magic powers.
    1) Is magic commonplace and every player can attempt casting a spell? There is no need to use Magic as a training attribute in this case, because training is not required to use it. You can consider adding it as a main attribute if it is that relevant to the setting, as it can add new situational bonus to the game, offering a finer control and skill definition.
    2) Is magic something most players can't do without some level of studying and learning? Then set Magic to either trained or untrained and limit its use to those trained. Also consider if and how characters can gain training during the game.
    3) Is magic so rare and precious that only a selected few will ever dream of using it after studying for a very long time? Set the Magic as a training attribute as before, but feel free to require a cost of training, which could be a penalty on another attribute, requirement for expensive resources and materials or something else that will force the player to consider his choice carefully. Magic is so powerful and rare in this case that its choice is actively penalized.
    The previous case, illustrates an example of how a training attribute can be used to control access to certain skills. However, training attributes could also be dependent on the main attributes. Let's think about another example. Heavy armour is usually something with a highly restrictive use. It requires strong, highly trained, combat-focused characters. How would this be reflected in this system? Simply give it a dependency that is, make it depend on something else. In this case, Heavy armour can be a training attribute which depends on the combat attribute being 1, so only players that are physically trained and combat-focused can be trained on using heavy armour.
    Note that these ideas can be extended to any other attributes. Are the players from a peace-loving community? You can make Violence a training attribute! Do they live in a realm that centralizes and monopolizes the means of violence? Then maybe adding a Weapons training attribute could reflect that!
