Welcome to my little page for a PbP system developing and testing :)
I am currently running two playtest games on [GP](https://gamersplane.com/), which you can check here:  
  
  1) [The Master's Vault](https://github.com/CN3ves/System/test1.html): using the basic [rules v01](https://github.com/CN3ves/System/rules1.html)  
  2) [The Legacy of the Crystal Shard](https://github.com/CN3ves/System/test2.html): using the written [rules v02](https://github.com/CN3ves/System/rules2.html)  
    
I'm working on the updating the rules to use for the next game as [rules v0.3](https://github.com/CN3ves/System/rules3.html)
