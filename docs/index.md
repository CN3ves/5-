1) Introduction
---------------------
[back to beginning](#table-of-contents)  
The 5+ system is a light, simple and flexible dice gaming system that can be used in various gaming contexts. 
It focuses on free-form narrative and player freedom, instead diving deep into the mechanistic details, keeping 
the story flowing at a good pace, while guaranteeing the possibility of building complex characters and their 
development, using nothing but <span style="color:green">two six-sided dice (2d6)</span>, a pencil and a notebook. Being a generic gaming system, 
it can be adapted to fit a diversity of settings, game styles, concepts and adventures. Specific options are 
included to allow the players to drive the story, distributing and decentralising of the Game Master’s task 
for a wider shared storytelling experience. The addition of a standard French-suited deck allows for easy 
single player options.  
  
The 5+ system is a descriptor-oriented system. 
This mean that <span style="color:green">descriptors</span> represent the underlying framework that can be easily adapted to accommodate 
many types of character concepts, game styles and genres. Using this framework, players can generate 
the game and setting that best suits them. Understanding descriptors, how to use them and how they 
interact is the essence of this gaming system.  

2) Descriptors
---------------------
[back to beginning](#table-of-contents)  
Descriptors are small, clear sentences that define someone or something. 
Unsurprisingly, adding descriptor together is what allows you to describe anything in your game, 
including how characters relate to other characters and how it differs from each other. 
*<span style="color:grey">For example, a character can be defined by as an explorer navigating exotic waters 
in search of new trading opportunities, which is different from the honor bound noble warrior that will 
fine the lost ship after a strong storm blew it off course.</span>*  

An important characteristic of this system is that, given the freeform nature of descriptors, 
these can be generated on the fly as required. Taken to the extreme, this could mean that no character 
creation is required to start a game!
*<span style="color:grey">Let’s assume the noble warrior meets the explorer, who shows him a new powerful 
weapon, firearms. The warrior has never seen this type of device, so he would not have the descriptor that 
allows him to use firearms.  Even though it is missing, you can quickly agree that, given time to 
train using the new weapons, the players may add this descriptor to their (fluid) descriptor list.</span>*  

Descriptors are combinations of <span style="color:green">characteristics</span>. 
To make any type of descriptor, you simply need to come up with an idea of what you want to describe 
and determine the combination that matches that best. These specific combinations can be grouped into descriptor subgroups to help generating a character and run a game. The descriptor characteristics are:  

* <span style="color:green">Effect</span>: Converts the free-form description (idea) into a mechanic effect, 
such as bonus and penalties, or describes how it interacts with other descriptors.  
* <span style="color:green">Counter</span>: Reflects accumulation of effects such as damage, 
strain and reputation and so on.  
* <span style="color:green">Level</span>:  Defines how efficient the descriptor is, reflecting the chances of 
successfully using it. Optionally, levels can also lead to more powerful effects which are measured by a tier.   

*Note:* The suggested annotation used is *descriptor name (counter/level:tier) – effects*. 
*<span style="color:grey">An intuitive example would be a general descriptor like Health (0/3:1) - Health reflects 
the general good physiological and psychological functioning of the character’s body and mind: If the damage 
accumulated to Health is above its level, the character gains a wound descriptor. The damage accumulated resets 
to 0 if the wound level below Health’s tier, otherwise, the character is incapacitated.</span>*
