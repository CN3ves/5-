Welcome to my little page for developing and testing the 5+ system. This system aims to be a simple and general way to play any type of RPG, with a particular focus on play-by-post (PbP) gaming. The idea is to provide simplified and minimal rules that allow to keep the game flowing at a good narrative pace, while guaranteeing  logical character development. This is a free-form, 2d6 skill-based system, and should be flexible and adaptable enough to allow anything to be used or done, as long as it is reasonable within the game's setting.

**Quick rules**:

*Call action*:
  1. Create a character concept you want to play with 2 or 3 abilities or traits.
  2. The turn is introduced by the scene owner.
  3. You can move, do something and defend yourself. 
  4. Whenever you want to do something, describe your intentions, roll a 2d6 and name a suitable skill.   

*Skill check*  
  5. Calculate your skill modifier by summing your speciality, your skill level and any situational bonus or descriptor effect. Subtract your skill fatigue from that value.
  6. If you modifier is positive and sum of your 2d6 roll is within the range of 5 and 5 + modifier (including both), you succeed.
  7. If you modifier is negative and sum of your 2d6 roll is 5 - modifier, you succeed.
  8. If you rolled a 1 in any of the dice, use that to add a "but" twist to your result.
  
*Failure* 
  9. If you fail, keep the lowest die.
  10. If you failed, try to handle it creatively. Failing does not have to mean failing!  
  11. If you failed and may take damage as consequence, add 1 wound counter. If the number of counters is above the value of the kept die, you gain one level of wounds. 
  12. If you failed an action you started, add 1 stress counter. If the number of counters is above the value of the kept die, you gain one level of stress. 
  
*Level up*
  13. If you rolled a double and the value repeated value is above the level of the skill you're using, level up the skill.
  14. If your skill level is now 4, upgrade the skill to a new tier, gain one level on any other skill and learn an ability.
  15. If your skill levels up with a double 6 (maximum level), you gain a +1 bonus to the next tier of that skill.
  
*Resolve turn*
  16. The actions of all intervening characters, both playable (PC) and non-playable (NPC) are described based on the results and a new turn is started.
