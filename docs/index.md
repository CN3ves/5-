Welcome to my little page for developing and testing the 5+ success range system. This system aims to be a simple and general way to play any type of RPG, with a particular focus on play-by-post (PbP) gaming. The idea is to provide simplified and minimal rules that allow to keep the game flowing at a good narrative pace, while guaranteeing logical and flexible character development. This is a free-form, 2d6 skill-based system, and should be flexible and adaptable enough to reproduce any idea or material from any other source.

> Quick start character guidelines:  
>  1) Choose the character concept.<br>
>  2) Pick a racial, a profession, a physical and a mental trait.
>  3) Select 2 skills from each of blocks in the skill examples. You are allowed to switch from one block to another, to a maximum of 4 skills per block. Set all the chosen skills to level 2.<br>
>  4) Pick one personal starting ability (a signature move for example).
>  5) Roll 2d6 for physical, social and mental fatigue. Set the lowest number as the resistance value and the highest as the break-point.

### 1.1 Descriptors
*([top]())*
Descriptors are small, clear sentences that define the character, how it differs from all other people in the world and what its current status is. As such, anything that can be said about the character is a descriptor. Descriptors are free-form and limited only by the setting, the players' imagination and a hint of good sense. For example, some meaningful descriptor groups would include:  
  
  * **Permanent descriptors** are those that do not change. They may be gained or lost, depending on the characters' actions in the game, but these are long-term defining characteristics.  

    * *The concept* is the only descriptor required at the start of the game. The concept is a short description that summarises and defines what actions are allowed (or not) for the character. If there is a concept, there is a character!  
    > *For example, you can consider the common race/class/specialization as a starting point (Elf, Wizard, Illusion) and add adjectives and a background (Educated, Charming, Noble) to create the concept of Educated and Charming Elven Noble Illusionist*.  
  
    * *Traits* reflect any permanent and static physical or mental characteristics of the character and should be both positive and negative. As such, players should try to elaborate further their own trait descriptors, particularly by ensuring there is a downside to them. Examples of traits would include inheritable racial features, acquired cultural behaviours and any noticeable physical or personality features. Based on their character concept, players should consider how they want their character to be. If it fits the concept, then it can be added to the character.  
    > An elven racial trait could be "Magical attunement but feeble", while they may be from a culture of art lovers that put "understand artistic value over material value". Elves are "physically beautiful" but this wizard as "a burned scar" covering most of his body from a alchemical accident. The wizard is also "well mannered and charming", but "slightly arrogant and impatient".  
    
    * *Training* correspond to the actual experience, studies and learning the character has acquired based on the concept. These descriptors are used to unlock sets of skills that the character has access to, so the players should consider the sort of actions their character will be doing.  
    > A wizard would be trained in spell-casting, alchemy and have deep arcane understanding, but no formal combat training.  

  * **Ranked descriptors** are those that can use used and improved, forming the core of the levelling system. Given the requirements, all ranked descriptors are assumed to be available to every character, even if they are not explicitly listed. As such, these descriptors can be made on the fly as required to describe the character's actions. Ranked skills have a (X:Y:Z) rank notation, were each value represent a level on different power tiers.  
    > *For example, a descriptor (5:3:0) can be used at power 1 level 5, at power 2 level 3 or at power 3 level 0.*
   
    * *Skills* are the general adventuring actions a character may attempt to do. Skills include every regular action that can fail and be improved, from using weapons and armour to interacting with other creatures and objects.  
    > *For an illusionist, relevant skills could be, invisibility, create sound, create image, distract and fast talk.*

    * *Abilities* represent any particular action that the character has mastered, a signature move or an individual take on a regular skill. Abilities add an extra twist the character's skill and provide the opportunity to add special effects to an action, reflecting critical skill successes. Thus, abilities can be though of as advanced skills.
    > *Fast talking is important for an illusionist to keep the audience both engaged and distracted, it is a deception skill that can have the added effect of confusing the target*

    * *Resistances* are descriptors that provide ways of measuring how much a character can take. Resistances are defined by a resistance value (tier 1) and a break-point (tier 2), that is, a value until which fatigue penalties are not applied and a value at which the character is incapacitated.

  * **Temporary descriptors** are those are frequently gained and lost. These mostly correspond to *conditions* reflecting unusual character's state. Conditions may be removed after some time or they may be curable. However, some of these descriptor may be converted into permanent descriptors (*traits*) is ignored for too long.  
  > *A character falls of a cliff and breaks his leg. It is decided that the broken leg condition can be healed with a the medical intervention. If the intervention is successful, the broken leg condition requires only some time and rest to be removed. However, if the medical treatment is provided by someone unskilled, it may results in permanent injury.*
