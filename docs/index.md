This system aims to be a simple and general way to play any type of RPG, with a particular focus on play-by-post (PbP) gaming. As such, the idea is to provide simplified rules that allow to keep the game flowing at a good narrative pace. In addition, the system is free-form, so it allows anything to be used or done, as long as it is reasonable within the game's setting. The way it works is:  
  
  1. The scene is introduced and the players describe *their intentions*.
  2. Each player *call for an action or an effect*.
  3. Every action is resolved by rolling two six-sided dice (2d6) and sum up the values.
  4. The actions of all intervening characters, both playable (PC) and non-playable (NPC) are described based on the results.

### 1.1 Character Creation  
[go to top](#table-of-contents)

<details>
  <summary>1. Define the character concept using a two or three word description.</summary>
  <i>For example, you can consider the common race/class/specialization as a starting point (Elven Wizard of Illusion) or add adjectives to your background (Educated and Charming Noble)</i>. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>2. Choose the character's general <a href="#12-character-attributes">strength and weakness</a>, if any.</summary>
  <i>In what type of situations would the character feel more comfortable? Did the character have extensive combat training? Maybe the charatcer prefers to spend time with others? Or perhaps the charatcer has spend most of his time dealing with intricate equipment?</i>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>3. Think how you wish to role-play the character, and what <a href="#13-character-skills">sort of actions</a> you'd want it to do. </summary>
  <i>Will the character walks in the shadows, spying on his enemies? Or will it solve most problems at sword's point? Will the character control the elements or channel life into others?</i>
</details>
  
<details>
  <summary>4. Determine if there are any defining characteristics that distinguishes the character.</summary>
  <i>For example, are there any inheritable racial features, or particular cultural or professional skills that may be acquired? Perhaps some personal ability gained from past experiences?</i>
</details>
  
<details>
  <summary>5. Consider how your character will react to the ever increasing frustration and stress of adventuring.</summary>
  <i>How does the character behave under stress or when the frustration is too just too much to handle? Will it retreat from society or pray to the gods? Will the character become agressive and arrogant? Will it just break down and cry itself to sleep?</i>
</details>
  
### 1.2 Character attributes
[go to top](#table-of-contents)

Attributes reflect the general aptitudes the character have for [*specific situations*](#21-conflict-structure). These mostly remain constant throughout the character's adventuring life:  

> **Brawl**: Reflects an extensive battle and combat training, both psychical and mental. Influences the character's effectiveness when in violent confrontation with other creatures *(combat situations)*. 
  
> **Mingle**: Reflects an extensive understanding of others' motives, desires and feelings. Influences the character's effectiveness when interacting non-violently with sentient creatures *(social situations)*. 
  
> **Check**: Reflects a particular eye for details and understanding what they mean. Influences the character's effectiveness when dealing with objects and finding out-of-place details *(other situations)*.
<details>
  <summary><u><i>At Character Creation...</i></u></summary>
  All attributes are set to 0, reflecting an average effectiveness for each type situation. A player can choose one single attribute that his character excels at (+1), by sacrificing another attribute (-1), indicating that the character spent more time than usual doing one type of situation, and consequently less time than usual practising the other.
</details>

### 1.3 Character skills
[go to top](#table-of-contents)

If the attributes are what distinguishes the characters' broad strengths or weaknesses, skills are the fine differences that will make a character unique. Skills refer to anything a character may do *and so include every possible action* that can fail and be improved, from using weapons and armour to interacting with other creatures and objects. While the attributes are a small set of limited options, the idea is to have a free and fluid skill's list, allowing skills to be made up *on the fly* as required. Skills measure how good the character is at doing a given action and are defined by their level (mastery) and tier (power). 

For example, skills could be broadly divided into the following categories:

<blockquote>
<details>

  <i>Linguistics: Languages, Runes, Decipher Script, etc. </i><br>
  <i>Professional: Alchemy, Metallurgy, Clockwork, etc. </i><br>
</details>
 
 

<details>

</details>
</blockquote>

  <summary><u><i>At Character Creation ...</i></u></summary>
  All skills start at level 0 (tier 0). Select a total of 2 suitable skills from each of the following groups:<br>
  * Combat and Magic/Technological skills (+1 or -1 skill as per Combat attribute).<br>
  * Social and Perception skills (+1 or -1 skill as per Social attribute).<br>
  * Movement and manipulation skills (+1 or -1 skill as per Explore attribute).<br>
  Set the chosen skills to level 2 and then choose 3 more skills from any list and set them to level 3. 
</details>

### 1.4 Character progression  
[go to top](#table-of-contents)

A “learn by doing” levelling system is suitable for the intended skills’ fluid dynamics and flexibility:  
  
  1. Every time you roll a 2d6 for a skill check, if the result is a double (same value on both dice) you level up that skill if the rolled value is above your *current skill level plus skill tier*. 
  2. *When you reach level 4 of a skill*, you upgrade your skill to a higher tier.
  3. *Once you reach the maximum level of a skill* (level up with a double 6), add a permanent +1 bonus to the same skill on the next tier.
  
**Upgrading**: While the skill level represents how successful the character is using the skill, the skill tier reflects the power, specificity, methodology and deeper understanding of the skill. Higher power and more advanced methods are more difficult to handle. When upgrading a skill tier, you gain:  
  
  1. Training (+1 level) on another skill of the current tier.    
  2. A new [ability](#15-character-abilities) at tier 0 and level 0 attached to your skill. These abilities should provide special effects on top of the base skill.   
  <details><summary>3. A higher tier version of the same skill at level 0 (but you maintain the previous skill!)</summary>
  <i>For example a character with the Use Poisons skills at tier 0 and level 3 rolls double 4s. As such, the character upgrades the skill from Use Poisons(3) to Use Poisons(4:0). This notation shows the level of the skill for each tier unlocked, so if the player may use Use Poisons at tier 0 level 4 or at tier 1 level 0, depending on the situation, since these tiers reflect the use of stronger poisons and the different safety methods associated with handling them.</i> 
  </details>  

<details><summary><u>Training</u>: Characters can only use skills that reflect their concept and background. As such, all characters are considered untrained in these skills unless otherwised stated. All characters are allowed to train and study to unlock skills as fitting to the story and game setting. </summary>
  <i>An uneducated tribal warrior may automatically fail magic/technological skills and some "civilised" knowledge (dynastic succession rules) and social skills (court etiquette) for example</i> 
  </details>  

### 1.5 Character abilities  
[go to top](#table-of-contents)

With skills being all the actions that a character may do, abilities are the extra twist the character adds to the skill. Abilities provide the opportunity to add special effects to a skill, reflecting the character improvement and mastery, his personal take on the way skills can be used. As such, abilities are *attached* to a given skill. Despite the similarities, abilities progression differs from skill progression as:  
  
  1. Abilities' level is capped to -1 the level of the skill it is attached. As such, that do not reach the maximum level (roll double 6 only to level up) and do not provide the maximum level +1 bonus.
  2. Upgrading an ability to the next tier does not provide training to a skill or a new ability, it simply unlocks a more higher tier version of the ability. 

*For example:*
  
  * Upgrading Sword skill you may gain the Iaijutsu ability (counter attack on defence).
  * Upgrading Fire spell: you may gain the Burning Bolt ability (burn condition) or Fire Ball (+1 target). 
  * Upgrading History knowledge:you may gain the more specialised knowledge about Noble Families (ability).


## 2. Conflict
### 2.1 Conflict Structure
[go to top](#table-of-contents)

This system uses turns to structure the game, where **each turn is made by a single intervention from every player**, giving the opportunity for every player to take an action if he wishes to do so. Importantly, **all actions withing a turn occurs simiultaneously** so there is no clear initiative or turn order. At the begging of each turn, the previous actions are resolved, the consequences described and the new situation introduced. **Conflict arises any time the outcome of the players' actions is uncertain**. As such, each conflict should reflect a specific situations matching one of the [character's attributes](#12-character-attributes). All conflicts are solved with a narrative approach, where the results from the previous turn inform on the behavior of the NPCs on the next turn. *This is to say that, for example, a dragon does not have to be bashed to a pulp of negative HP to be defeated, its actions are determined by the number of successes and failures the players accumulated during the conflict, where each success reflect a new action, approach or consideration noticeable by the players*. 

### 2.2 Conflict actions
[go to top](#table-of-contents)

During conflict, **each player is allowed to move and choose one other actions each turn** with a potential defense action being called if the character is attacked. Actions are free-form and if the player comes up with an idea, that should be implemented within reason. Basic actions include:

  > **Move action**: cover 1 "space" of movement.  
  > **Attack action**: actively attempt to cause damage to a target (either with sword or word!)  
  > **Defence action**: protect from and adversary's attack or insult (dodge, evade, shield, etc.)  
  > **Manoeuver action**: try to impose a disadvantage on a target (disarm, hide, gain terrain advantage, etc.)  
  > **Interact action**: interact with items, be it picking them from the floor or from a bag, reloading a weapon or drinking a potion, etc.  
  > **Recover action**:** recover from a previous attack or simply fall back to overview the battle field or catch some breath
  
**Stances**: However, given the limited scope of these basic actions, the players may attempt to take a spefific stances, adding more strategic options. Stances reflect how the character is currently approaching conflict. Based on the intended approach, the player can call a stance [effect](#24-conflict-effects) to: 
  
  * Gamble an action for additional bonus. *An agressive player may wish to gamble away the defence action to attempt a new attack, depending on the first attack being successful or a spellcaster may gamble away his success in order to attack an extra target*.
  * Shifting bonus and penalties to improve a specific action. *A defensive character may wish to take a +1 defensive bonus in exchange for a -1 attack bonus or a manouvering charatcer may put his efforts on outsmarting the target for a +1 manoeuver bonus and the cost of a -1 defense penalty.*
  
**Movement**:In this system, there are no grids, maps or any other sort of objective locations and positions during conflicts. The general layout is described, highlighting particularities that could be used for or against the players and all characters involved will start in relative positions to each other. Each character can be close, nearby, in range or out of range to any other character:
* Close enemies can be attacked normally with melee weapons, but with a -1 penalty for ranged weapons and magic. If hit once,
ranged attackers will be forced into a defensive position and see their attack disrupted.
* Nearby enemies can be attacked with melee weapons (after moving), long reach weapons, ranged weapons and magic.
* In range enemies can be attacked with ranged weapons and magic.
* Out of range enemies can be attacked only with higher level magic.
Positions are not linear, but exponentially spread. The character occupies the close space and need to move 1 "spaces" to a nearby position, 2 "spaces" to get to an in range target or 4 "spaces" to reach an out of reach target. 


> **New skills**: So... there is no need for a defined, detailed and extensive list of all skills that may be used during the game from the start right? But what if you want to call on a skill that "doesn't exist"? Well, simply add it to the list at level 0. If it wasn't there to start with, then you have no experience with it anyway. When a new skill is called, players should:
1) Is that action really not covered by any existing skill already? Note that how this question is approached will define how detailed a game's skill list is. Saying that the action jumping in distance is not covered by the skill jumping in altitude, means that the skill list is defined at a very fine level. This can work just as well as saying that jumping is jumping regardless of direction.
2) Does the character have any skills that may be related to the new one? If so, the character may be allowed to start with at most half the existing skill experience. It is easy to think that if someone can swim in a pool, then swimming in the sea (which is more difficult) is not such a challenge compared to someone that does not know how to swim at all!
3) Completely new skills are just that, new. No character has ever attempted it so they start at level 0. As the character rides his very medieval horse closer to the stunning and strange alien spaceship, the player just feels an intense need to flying it! The character has no alien-related skills, so the space-faring skill is added to the list at level 0



> **Magic (area/shape skills)**: 
In principle, magic is just a skill like any other skill, so you use it as you'd use your sword skill. One difference is that, a spell can be shaped and increase the area of effect, while that would be difficult to do that with a sword. As such, the skill level determines how many targets a spell can have, which will also define the possible shapes of a spell. Before casting a spell, you must decide on the power of the spell. The spell power is the number of targets the spell will have, with the possibility of repeating the same target. For each new target the spell skill level is reduced by 1, which means that more powerful spells are more difficult to cast. A player decides to cast a fire spell, which is a level 3 skill. The player decides to use the maximum spell power. Because the minimum level is 0, the fire skill can only be reduced 3 times, meaning that the maximum number of targets is 3. However, the player decides that the spell is focused around on particular enemy, which will be targeted twice (or once with higher power) and use the "leftover" target on another nearby enemy. The fire spell is then muli-casted 3 times at level 0. Once the spell power is chosen, the next choice is the shape of the spell, which it will determine the possible targets and how one can defend from it. A line spell can hit targets in "different zone" and will be dodgeable, while splash spell will hit all target in one or "two zones" and will only be blockable. Increasing the spell power, not only makes it more difficult to cast, it also puts extra strain on the caster. For each roll (target), if the lowest dice value is below the number of targets considered, add 1 casting strain. Casting strain applies only to the specific magic skill used and restores 1 per turn where the character does not cast a spell. If you multi-cast a fire spells with four targets, then for each of the 4 rolls, take the lowest value. The number of dice values below 4 is the casting-strain applied specifically to fire spells, all other spells being unaffected. Be careful as casting strain is a mental effort, so the strain left for each individual magic skill will be individually converted to frustration at the end of the conflict. Abusing magic powers is a quick way to insanity!
Note that magic is the only way to target out-of-range, so this comes at a cost. Targeting someone that far away adds additional strain on the caster, so each out-of-range target counts as two targets (that is, requires one lower level roll).There are two particularities about spells: one is that, unlike weapons, it is something you may want to target yourself. The other is that not all spells are created equally. So in the first case, if you are targeting someone willing to take the spell effect, there is no way you can fail! This type of casting should be treated as a regular skill check and dealt with the same failure handling methods as other simple conflicts, with forcing the success at the cost of frustration being particularly a suitable solution. The second issue includes magical effects such as mind control, reflect magic, long lasting spells and other unbalanced spells. The complication about these spells is that they are, in fact, complex conflicts. Let's consider mind manipulation and say that a player wants to enslave the bartender, so he has free beer. Complete mind control is such a strong effect that no single casting can do it. It requires the building up of magical effects to reach such a powerful effect. For example:
* The player can use his "mind magic" skill and the first success simply makes the barkeeper pay attention to the character.
* The second check is a non-magical check for "personality skill" to pass the a first chit-chat encounter and become friendly with the bartender.
* The third check could be another magic check to reinforce the friendship feelings towards the player.
* The fourth check may require some sort of non-magical plea for the barkeeper's help, confirming that he would be on the characters' side.
* Given his readiness to help, a fifth magical check can settle the bartender bias in favour of the player.
And so on, slowly working the barkeeper until he is irresistibly and unquestionably following the player's orders. Note how the magical effects are mostly statementing and reinforcing the underlying feelings already present. This can be worked over days or months, going back and forwards as spells and social interactions skills will alternatively fail and succeed.

## 2.3 Conflict Resolution
[go to top](#table-of-contents)

> **Success range**: The original method to estimate the success range is to add 5 to the resulting modifier (bonus and penalties). When rolling 2d6, any resulting sum that falls between 5 and that number (inclusive) is a success.
After some drinks in this tavern, I feel like exploring a bit more this new city and try to go to the next tavern. I have two levels of drunken walking so:
1) Reference number and lower bound of the success range is 5
2) My modifier is 2, so the upper bound of the success range is 7
3) If I roll a sum in this range (5,6 or 7) I can make it to the next tavern, otherwise I'll need to handle the failure. The success range, even though simple, is a fairly strange concept for many players and may take a while to get used to. An alternative method can be derived by again thinking 5. Note that the success range is 5+ (from 5 to 5+modifier). So if you roll 2d6-5 instead, the success range is centred to 5-5 to 5+modifier-5, that is from 0 to the modifier. The result is converted to a roll less than the modifier type of system!

> **Modifiers**: So, what is that modifier that is used to calculate the success range? That modifier is the sum of all bonuses and penalties that apply to the skill being checked. The basic modifier is the level of the skill being called by the player so being more skilled at something means that there are more values resulting in a successful action. In addition, each situation is associated with a main attribute, which value is also applied as either a (+1) bonus or a penalty (-1) depending on the value of the conflict attribute of a character. Note that this implies that the same skill can have very different success rates depending on the situation. For example, a character with a sword skill of 3 and Combat attribute of 1 and Social attribute of -1 will have a modifier of 4 when trying to cut down a goblin, but only a modifier of 2 if showing off his sword skills to someone. This can be interpreted as the character being awkward handling his sword, but it still cuts when it hits a goblin! Situational bonuses and penalties may additionally be applied referring either to conditions affecting the character (hidden, poisoned) or to particularly easy or difficult situations. The character dodge skill level is 4, with combat attribute 0. If the character gets into a tavern brawl with drunk clients, then maybe it is easier to dodge and a +1 bonus is applied for a resulting modifier of 5. Likewise, dodging a goblin's sword is ok, but dodging a giant's sweeping club, is probably more difficult, providing a -1 penalty for a modifier of 3. The last factor to take into account is the strain penalties. As a conflict progresses, it is likely that the characters will accumulate physical or mental strain from their efforts, reducing their conflict capacity until they are not able to continue. For each strain penalty taken, the character gets a cumulative -1 to the conflict attribute.
Two things of notice:
1) Any skill with a negative modifier automatically fails because 5 is removed from the success range (but can still wield experience). This means that rolling a sum value of 2,3 or 4 is an automatic fail.
2) It is also worth mentioning that equipment can also have an indirect effect on the modifier as it can change both the skill and attribute valuesIn summary, the success range is defined by:
1) The lower bound 5
2) The constant conflict attribute value (affected by rare equipment)
3) The chose skill level (affected by common equipment)
4) Effect and situational modifiers (called effects)
5) The ever increased strain penalty

### 2.4 Conflict effects
[go to top](#table-of-contents)


> Besides deciding on what actions to do, players may also decide to call on an effect. Effects arise when handling failure or as a result of a condition acquired by the player. Calling on an effect generally allows players to make tradeoffs, temporally removing the default effect. For example, consider how you can:
* Accept an instantaneous worsening of the penalty for a chance to ignore it in the future.
* Give up a bonus to provoke a specific effect.
* Take on a different penalty. 

> **Failure handling**: If a character succeeds, them the action is completed as intended. However, there are many ways of failing. The most important thing to keep in mind is that failure should keep the story flowing instead of bringing it to a halt, leaving the players with no options or just delaying the inevitable by allowing infinite re-rolls. Failure handling should assume that given time and resources, the players will not fail unless something happens. From this follows that failure is an opportunity to add complications, twist and new developments to the story that the players need to consider. So, instead of simply failing, the players can call on an alternative failure handling effect. Consider the following failure effects (and try to come up with others!):
1) The action is time-sensitive: Failing allows a limited number of repetitions, gradually increasing the tension with each failure. A tyrant lord is about to execute the hostages, one by one. As infiltrated agents, the players try to convince him that sparing the prisoners would be wiser, because the princess they want to rescue is the fourth hostage in the line of execution. Each failure will result in another slain hostage.
2) The action is interrupted: Failing once prevents the action from being repeated because something else happened, not because the player isn't skilled enough to do it. The player tries to jump over a wagon to get a clean shot at the tyrant lord, however, the wagon's owner shows up and starts to comment the on-going public execution with the player.
3) The action succeeds anyway: Fail forward is an interesting concept that allows the player to succeed even if they fail, but with an added twist or complication. It is similar to having the action interrupted, but it allows for the player to get what he wants. As the player is looking for the incriminating secret papers in the tyrant lord's office, even though the player manages to identify and take them, the paper weight that was on the table is dropped, making a very noticeable noise.
4) Forced success: When a player fails an action, it can be converted to a success by pushing the character to its limits, for example by increasing a level of frustration or getting wounded. This is in fact the common way to solve failing defence actions in combat. When players are hit by a sword waving guard, instead of being wounded, the player automatically calls on a forced success effect and escapes untouched, at the cost of gaining physical strain (trading the permanent penalty for a temporary one!)
**Helping**: The success rates in this system a

> **Narration effects**: To keep thinks more interesting, when a 1 is rolled in any dice, the next player must call a narration but effect, that is, describe the action resolution as normally but add an extra sentence starting with but. This effect attenuates the results of the action, so for a failed roll, the player fails but there was something positive, while for a successful roll there was a consequence unaccounted. The player tries to hide before the guards come into the room. He fails to find a place to hide, but he notices an open window through which he can escape.
The opposite situation would be a call to narration and effect. These are done when the player rolls a double, regardless of the dice values. Similarly, the effect is to provide unexpectedly enhance the action's result, so players' fail then something worse happens, or if the players' succeeds and something better occurs. The player successfully climbs over the wall (and) as he recovers from his back pain.

> **Descriptors**: During the adventure, characters will often experience unexpected conditions, situations and difficulties. Descriptors reflect any unusual effect the character is under, either mechanistically or dramatically, including situational bonuses, conditions penalties or any other effect than is not the default character state. A poisoned character may feel weaker, a paralysed character wouldn't be able to move, while a character with a broken arm may just be able to carry on almost unaffected. Generally, conditions provide a +1 bonus or -1 penalty when calling an action on which their effect can logically be associated. A character with a hidden descriptor will gain a +1 bonus when trying a surprise attack, whereas a weakened character will gain -1 penalty to moving furniture into the new apartment. However, specific descriptors may reflect stronger penalties, effectively preventing certain actions. Being asleep or petrified will prevent moving or taking actions, while a character that is muted or silenced will not be able to talk, and having a broken arm will prevent the character from using two handed weapons. The default effect of a descriptor is defined when the descriptor is acquired, being called by whoever induces it (generally by the GM).
To avoid these default penalties, the player can call on the descriptor effect as well, paying a higher cost now for a chance of improving the effects. 1) A poisoned character receives a -1 penalty for any physical skills. However, the player may call on the poison effect, suggesting that the character suddenly feels a bit dizzy from the conflict effort and takes some time to recover. At the cost of skipping a turn, the poison's default modifier will be ignored the lowest value of a 2d6 roll, reflecting the characters recovered focus after taking some time to rest
2) On the other hand, a player may call on the sleeping effect to wake up a character immediately, but having a -1 sleepy or unprepared penalty equal to the highest value of a 2d6 roll.
3) Finally, a character with optimal positioning may give up his +1 bonus for an extra or stronger attack, inducing extra strain on the enemy or maybe cause a disarmed or panic condition to his enemy.
Again, players should feel free to call on custom effect and add new and unique takes on their descriptors.

> **Wounds and Frustration**: Even though conflict is not deadly, wounds can occur. In addition, the constant struggle can put a lot of mental pressure on the characters. As mentioned before, strain is a "forced success" failure handling tradeoff, where permanent wounds are avoided by placing additional (temporary) strain on the characters. However, this tradeoff is not without its drawbacks (otherwise it would be just a trade with no "off"). Wounds and frustration still occur as a side-effects of accumulated strain so, at the end of each conflict as the characters rest and all their strain is removed, there is a chance that a character was wounded either directly by an enemy or indirectly by the strain placed on his body (muscle injury from a bad swing). To determine if a character received a physical or mental wound, roll 2d6 and, if the the lowest dice value is equal or less than the strain accumulated during that conflict, the character was wounded in combat or became stressed from a difficult social interaction by that amount. Notice that “Obverse-based conflicts” are often simple and can be handled with without incurring strain penalties. If that is not the case, these conflicts can work both ways, either the player gets frustrated because we can’t track the bandits or he trips and falls as he tries to follow their tracks.
Physical and mental (stress/frustration) wounds have a maximum of 10 levels, at which point the character is exhausted from accumulated wounds or loses his mind completely, becoming unplayable. By having more than 5 levels of wounds, the player risks permanent damage in the form of a new descriptor. If the sum of the wound roll is below the level of the wound, then a new wound description is gained for physical wounds or the frustration trait kicks in for the mental wounds. 

So far, there are four types of damage characters are subjected to: temporary strain, permanent wounds, cumulative stress and descriptors.
* Strain is recovered completely as soon as the characters leave a conflict and assuming they can rest for a little while before moving into the next conflict.
* Frustration heals when the players are back to safety and have time to get a proper meal, drink and rest. For each relaxing moment the character has, its frustration is decreased by the lowest value on a 2d6 roll.
* Minor wounds (wound level up to 5) require simple treatment that can be provided by anyone, reducing the wound level by the difference between the lowest value on a 2d6 roll.
* Major wounds (wound level above 5) require trained medical treatment and access to adequate medical supplies. Proper medical care will reduce wounds by the highest value on a 2d6 roll.
* Descriptors do not heal by themselves and generally require a double roll (narration and effect) to be removed or adequate treatment to be obtained. Some physical wounds cannot be completely removed.

## 3. Other
### 3.1 Equipment
[go to top](#table-of-contents)

> In this system, characters do not level up or gain quanta of power at certain points in a deterministic way. They age and gain experience as one does! Characters can progress, or improve, in 3 different ways: gain experience with skills, acquire better equipment and learn new abilities.



> **Equipment**: As skills, equipment is free-form and can be defined on the fly. To create a new piece of equipment or item, simply name it by defining it by adding an adjective to the base name: Rusting Sword, Long Rope, Fast Horse, Long-ranged Rifle, Heavy Armour, Amazing Laser Blaster. To that, a small extra descriptor may be added if the equipment has any distinctive feature or power (compare useless robes with useless robes of might). Of course, super cool and legendary items can have names that are a reference to some historical or mythical place, event or person, and players could use these as opportunities for flashback chapters or as part of their character arcs.
Since the skill level is naturally capped at 5 by the way the system works, and that is still not a great success probability, equipment is a way to further improve the character. This can be done in 3 main ways:
1) Apply a bonus to a skill or, more rarely, attribute: There aren't really much more stats that can be affected by equipment. Equipment that provides bonus will be noted as +1/X (the casual penalty as -1/X), where +1 is the provided bonus (-1 the penalty) and X the maximum level obtainable with equipment. A cheap stick is +1/1, meaning that players get a +1 bonus on their stick (spear maybe?) skill as long as this bonus does not result in a modifier greater than of 1, so the equipment has no effect for players with stick skill at level 1. Likewise, a Balanced sword could be +1/3, which provided a bonus for players below sword level 3. This means that you may be too skilful to actually gain any bonus from your equipment.
2) The item has a descriptor which can be called: This allows for more general powers or effects to be imbued in the equipment. A poisoned dagger has poison descriptor, which can be called 3 times to induce poison on a target. A scroll of thunder has a thunder spell descriptor that can be called to use the thunder spell at the specified level. A helmet of speed has the fast descriptor, which is called to add another action to the player's turn. A hammer has the stun effect, which can be called to hit harder when out-manoeuvring an enemy Using descriptors allows for more flexibility in equipment creation.
3) Really powerful items may allow automatic fails to succeed: Note that since success is defined by a 5+ range, then rolling 2,3 or 4 automatically fails. However, certain items may allow skills to succeed by using a 4+ range instead. Some examples of items the characters may encounter are:
* Weapons: Weapons can increase the associated skill level with a +1 bonus, allow attacking up to a certain range, impose a disadvantages such as requiring re-loading or any other custom effect (stun, prone, immobilise).
* Protective gear: Armour, shields and other equipment used for protection can be used to prevent damage. This can be by adding a +1 bonus to defensive skills (dodge, block, be brutally smashed), providing guaranteed success descriptors (once per turn your heavy armour can be use to block an attack), immunity or resistance to certain types of damage or even adding an extra strain buffer!.
* Other gear: These are smaller items such as necklaces, rings and charms, which are unlikely to be related to any particular skill. These items may have setting specific functions, such as being required to cast spells: A level 3 water magic caster may not be able to cast any spells if her create water ring is not equipped (basically a generalization of the spell book concept). These items can provide other benefits such changing attribute values (ring of rudeness: -1 Social), modify specific skill bonus (sword rune: +1 sword skill), or any type of descriptor with effects such as automatic successes (mantle of rose scent: you automatically convince blind creatures you're a talking rose), magic immunity or any other effects.
* Consumables: Item such as potions and scrolls that are consumed upon use provide immediate rewards, such as healing wounds, removing strain, gaining bonuses or access to certain skills. Some items should be just what they say on the label (antidote, potion of strength, love potion, scroll of toad shape)
* Other: Any item can be relevant without changing the character stats or adding any magical descriptor. Walkie-talkies can have their mundane function and simply allow easier communication, where easier communication can then be used to set up ambushes.

### 3.2 Scenes
[go to top](#table-of-contents)


> **What do you see?**: After introducing any new scene, place or situation, the players should be asked what they see: Do you spot someone in the corner table? Is there something strange in the wall? Are all the books arranged strangely? Players should have the opportunity to contribute with interesting details in every scene, if nothing else just to add new descriptions to bring out different things about the places they visit.

> **Play your cards!**: Literally, there will be cards! Each player picks 3 cards at the start of the game. Each player will then be able to add rumours, hints and clues to the story, trying to drive players into their secret story arc. Once players take the bait, they play one card and discard the other 2, starting a player owned scene (that is, that player becomes the GM). The player can then move the character secret story arc forward, that is, players will GM their own character's arc! Whenever a new player takes over, the previous scene owner picks 3 new cardsCard suits: Each suit reflects a different type of quest or game-play. Hearts are for socializers, so these should include a relevant amount of interaction with NPCs (chatty enemies, distressed peasants, negotiating passage). Diamonds are for achievers, so these include or point to some clear reward or something the players can achieve or collect (rare equipment sets, money, status). Spades are for explorers, so these should introduce new lands, explain long lost secrets or clarify some historical event or any other discovery (background information, a rumours of distant lands, a secret revealed by an solving a puzzle). Finally, clubs are for killers, so these quests should should be filled with combat and fights (challenges of power, all out combat, arenas)

Card values: The numeric values of the cards illustrate the number of story conflicts the player can call on. These can be saved and accumulated, but are earned only when playing the card. So cards with higher values will allow for longer-lasting or more complex missions. Royals will represent important named enemies (possibly recurring). A Joker is a quest that has a change to gain a bless or new ability and in some way provide a significant improvement (being knighted by the king could be as important as a new ability!) while Aces represent conflicts leading to new friendly or helpful connection.
