## 1) Introduction  
The 5+ system is a light, simple and flexible dice gaming system that can be used in various gaming contexts. 
It focuses on free-form narrative and player freedom, instead of diving deep into the mechanistic details, keeping 
the story flowing at a good pace, while guaranteeing the possibility of building complex characters and their 
development, using nothing but <span style="color:green">two six-sided dice (2d6)</span>, a pencil and a notebook. Being a generic gaming system, 
it can be adapted to fit a diversity of settings, game styles, concepts and adventures. Specific options are 
included to allow the players to drive the story, distributing and decentralizing of the Game Master’s (GM) task 
for a wider shared storytelling experience. The addition of a standard French-suited deck allows for easy 
single player options.  
  
The 5+ system is a descriptor-oriented system. 
This mean that <span style="color:green">descriptors</span> represent the underlying framework that can be easily adapted to accommodate many types of character concepts, game styles and genres. Using this framework, players can generate 
the game and setting that best suits them. Understanding descriptors, how to use them and how they 
interact is the essence of this gaming system. Generally, each descriptor is created by defining at least one charatceristic, which in turns determines how the descriptor is resolved.

#### Descriptors  
Descriptors are small, clear sentences that define someone or something. 
Unsurprisingly, adding descriptor together is what allows you to describe anything in your game, 
including how characters relate to other characters and how it differs from each other. 
*<span style="color:grey">For example, a character can be defined as an explorer navigating exotic waters 
in search of new trading opportunities, which is different from the honor bound noble warrior that will 
find the lost ship after a strong storm blew it off course.</span>*  

An important characteristic of this system is that, given the freeform nature of descriptors, 
these can be generated on the fly as required. Taken to the extreme, this could mean that no character 
creation is required to start a game!
*<span style="color:grey">Let’s assume the noble warrior meets the explorer, who shows him a new powerful 
weapon, firearms. The warrior has never seen this type of device, so he would not have the descriptor that 
allows him to use firearms.  Even though it is missing, you can quickly agree that, given time to 
train using the new weapons, the players may add this descriptor to their (fluid) descriptor list.</span>*  

Descriptors are combinations of <span style="color:green">characteristics</span>. 
To make any type of descriptor, you simply need to come up with an idea of what you want to describe 
and determine the combination that matches that best. These specific combinations can be grouped into descriptor subgroups to help generating a character and run a game. The descriptor characteristics are:  

* <span style="color:green">Effect</span>: Converts the free-form description (idea) into a mechanic effect, 
such as bonus and penalties, or describes how it interacts with other descriptors.  
* <span style="color:green">Counter</span>: Reflects accumulation of effects such as damage, 
strain and reputation and so on.  
* <span style="color:green">Level</span>:  Defines how efficient the descriptor is, reflecting the chances of 
successfully using it. Optionally, levels can also lead to more powerful effects which are measured by a tier.   

*Note:* The suggested annotation used is *descriptor name (counter/level:tier) – effects*. 
*<span style="color:grey">An intuitive example would be a general descriptor like Health (0/3:1) - Health reflects 
the general good physiological and psychological functioning of the character’s body and mind: If the damage 
accumulated to Health is above its level, the character gains a wound descriptor. The damage accumulated resets 
to 0 if the wound level below Health’s tier, otherwise, the character is incapacitated.</span>*

## 2) Descriptor Characteristics  
### 2.1) Descriptor Effects   
Effects describe interactions between descriptors, allow or prevent certain actions or even define particular roleplaying guidelines. *<span style="color:grey">These include gaining a +1 bonus to a skill of group of skills, forbid the use of magic by non-casters, simply stating that the character has thermal vision or other non-default characteristic for the setting. For example, if the players are playing as underwater creatures, it is expected that that can breathe underwater, but maybe breathing air is not a given, so amphibious effect would need to be described.</span>* Descriptors with effects that are not expected to change describe stable, long-term characteristics of a character or object. As such, we can define these as a subgroup: <span style="color:green">traits</span>. This way, traits may include what is commonly thought of as ability scores, race, class, job or training. It additionally includes any physical and mental characteristics, personality, flaws, strengths, fears, background and even culture. Generally, they should describe defining features that distinguish the character or object. *<span style="color:grey"> For example, a strong character may have a trait descriptor Strong - you possess strength above the average person: you gain +1 bonus to non-combat actions involving strength. Even though being strong may not be a rare trait, it distinguishes the character of the average person. Another example would be the trait Moldable – the shape of this object can be changed easily, which distinguish it from most other object which have defined, unchangeable shapes (unless they break!)</span>* <sub><sup>[(Back to start)](#)</sup></sub>  

### 2.2) Descriptor Counter   
Counter are used to measure or count, keeping track of relevant numbers associated with the descriptors. The simplest example of such descriptors would be the subgroup <span style="color:green">resistances</span>. In the case of these descriptions, the counter can be interpreted as accumulated damage. Many facets of the character’s resistances can be captured the creation of appropriate resistances. *<span style="color:grey">The most obvious resistance is the physical resistance, which would be measure how much physical damage a character has taken, for example, during a combat. However, a spellcaster may strain his mind and accumulate mental damage while characters that push their limits may accumulate fatigue. Other examples would be fear and sanity, or even magic resistance!</span>* However, damage is not the only thing that can be counted. Amongst others, <span style="color:green">attitudes</span> or <span style="color:green">reputations</span> are other examples of measurable descriptors that can be relevant to use. In these cases, the counter may be thought beyond the damage concept, instead reflecting as accumulated social standing or reputation. *<span style="color:grey">A character may gain reputation in a new region by helping villagers fight raiders, who will spread the word of his deeds, or may reduce its reputation by being suspected of stealing a sacred artifact. Interestingly, one action may reduce one reputation descriptor but decrease another.</span>* <sub><sup>[(Back to start)](#)</sup></sub>  
  
### 2.3) Descriptor Level  
Levels describe the proficiency of the character for a given action. This means that it determines the success chances of a character successfully doing something. If there is a change of success, then it means descriptors with levels are those which effects are uncertain and may fail. *<span style="color:grey">A clan's warrior may be trying to pacify a nervous horse to build up his reputation with the clan nobles. Even though the warrior is highly trained handling horses, he may still not succeed in this particular case. The result of this action will depend on the past experiences of the warrior.</span>* Given that a descriptor level correlates with a character’s experience, it may be important that these descriptors can be improved. Descriptors with levels that can also be improved can defined the subgroup of <span style="color:green">skills</span>. As such, skills represent the general adventuring actions a character may attempt to do, that is, every regular action that can fail and be improved, including attack, defense and magic actions! *<span style="color:grey">For example, a warrior may have the skill descriptor Sword, which simply allows him to handle a sword and defines how skillful the character is doing so.</span>* <sub><sup>[(Back to start)](#)</sup></sub>  

#### Tiers  
Levels only describe the chances of using a descriptors successfully. However, the same skill can be used differently by different characters. This means that, even though two characters may be using the same skill with the same chances of success, one may still be trying to use a more powerful technique or method than the other. To distinguish different methods and approaches, <span style="color:green">tiers</span> of descriptor powers can be associated to their levels, where each tier represent a noticeable increase in descriptor power. *<span style="color:grey">We can think about the difference between two spellcasters, one apprentice and one archmage. If both are trying to cast a fire spell, it is clear that the archmage will succeed casting the same spell more often than the apprentice. However, if the archmage tries to cast a more powerful spell, his chances of summoning these more devastating energies may be the same as those of the apprentice  casting the simplest of spells. The difference is on the power and complexity of the spell. Even though magic is an easy example to understand, this concept can be extended to every other skill: the sword technique may be deadlier, the smiting method may be more efficient, the diplomatic approach may be more convincing, etc.</span> <sub><sup>[(Back to start)](#)</sup></sub>  

#### Characters 
Each player would have at least one character within the game. Characters are defined by their descriptors, but the character creation process depends on the theme and aim of the game and should be agreed upon at the set up. A character can be as simple as:
> **Skills**: Improvise(2:0) – you can do any action as improvisation  
> **Resistances**: Physical(0/3:0) – your resistance to physical damage. When the damage is higher than the level, you obtain a physical wound.  

This scaffold can be modified to include traits, training, a starting skill list and abilities as appropriate for the setting and starting character experience.  *<span style="color:grey">For example, skills can be further groups into basic skill groups to ensure balanced characters, such as physical, combat, social, magic, profession, knowledge, etc.</span>* Since levels define the chances of success, selecting starting descriptor levels defines the game difficulty, so you should refer to the table below:  
  
|Level|Descriptions|Chances|
|-----|------------|-------|
|  0  | Incompetent|  ~10% |
|  1  | Novice     |  ~25% |
|  2  | Trained    |  ~40% |
|  3  | Competent  |  ~50% | 
|  4  | Proficient |  ~70% |
|  5  | Specialist |  ~75% |
|  6  | Expert     |  ~80% |

The starting level selection should be done in a way that fits the players and setting best and should reflect the character's overall concept, *<span style="color:grey">for example:</span>*  
  
  * *<span style="color:grey">Fixed or negotiated: Simply assign a suitable level to descriptors</span>*  
  * *<span style="color:grey">Randomized creation: roll 2d6 for each descriptor and keep the worse value</span>*  
  * *<span style="color:grey">Buy Points: Assign a number of points to spend on each character, with the progression cost being the same as the cumulative levels being bought.</span>* <sub><sup>[(Back to start)](#)</sup></sub>  

## 3) Resolution Methods  
### 3.1) Success Range  
The system resolutions methods depend on characteristics available for a given descriptor, so that these methods may not be callable by all descriptors. <span style="color:green">Success range</span> is the method used when an action’s result is of uncertain. As such, success ranges are called to resolve situation where descriptors with level characteristic are used. This method takes into account both the character descriptors and the challenge itself, integrating all the values that modify the chances of a given action’s success, that is all <span style="color:green">modifiers</span>, into a range of values to which the sum of a 2d6 is compared to. If this sum is within the success range, then the action succeeds as intended. However, if the sum falls outside  the action fails or is somehow incomplete.  
*<span style="color:grey">If a player rolls 3 and 4 on their 2d6 check to ride a horse fast enough, then their final result is 7. This action will success as intended if 7 is included in the success range. For example, it would success were the success range 5-7, but not 5-6.</span>*  

To estimate the success range, thus the probability an action will succeed, it is important to consider the base value of 5, which is the default value at which an untrained character succeeds an action.  Let’s say then, there the base success range is 5-5 *(including the extremes)*. The upper value of this range can be extended *(hence the name 5+)* by the character’s <span style="color:green">proficiency</span>. The character proficiency is the sum of all bonuses and penalties the character’s descriptors provide. In general, these are the skill or resistance level modified by the trait or condition effects:   
  
1.	Choose any appropriate descriptor, such as a skill for an active action or a resistance for a passive, instinctive action. Subtract the damage (if available) from the level. 
2.	To that value, add all trait and condition bonuses and penalties to determine the final proficiency.
3.	In addition, <span style="color:green">challenge difficulty</span> may provide quick +1 bonus or -1 penalty adjustments to proficiency.
4.	Add the proficiency to 5 to determine the upper bound of the success range.

For longer running games, the lower value of the range may also be modified. Each challenge will have a <span style="color:green">rank</span>, reflecting the relative difference between the character skill technique and power *(tier)* and that required to overcome the challenge. These modifiers are also added to 5 to determine the success range lower bound. Unless there is a significant difference in difficulty, most challenges’ rank will be 0, meaning that the lower bound of the success range will be 5 except in rare situations.  
*<span style="color:grey"> A character trying to sneak past the castle guard is facing a challenge that requires a superior level of skill as the action occurs in plain daylight, so the challenge rank is defined as 2 (two tiers above the character). The character has two relevant descriptors: the sneak(4:1) skill and the ninja training trait (+1 bonus). The guards are on alert, since they intercepted a message and are expecting trouble (-1 situational penalty). The resulting upper bound is 5 + 4 (skill level) + 1 (training bonus) -1 (situation) = 9. The lower bound is 5 + 2 (rank) = 7. As such, the range of possible successful values is 7-9, meaning that if the sum of the 2d6 is 7, 8 or 9, the character’s action succeeds.</span>*

*Note* that, if the upper bound is below the lower bound, the range is invalid, and the character is not capable of succeeding no matter what. This means that, due to incompetence, natural toughness or magical means, the target of the action being effectively immune to the approach taken. <sub><sup>[(Back to start)](#)</sup></sub>   

#### Failure handling  
If the resulting sum of the 2d6 is within the success, 
then the action’s result is as intended. But if the result 
is outside this range, the action doesn’t have to simply fail. 
The most important thing to keep in mind is that failure should 
keep the story flowing instead of bringing it to a halt. 
As such, failure handling should assume that, unless something happens, 
given time and resources, characters would eventually complete the tasks 
they are familiar with. From this it follows that, regardless of the original 
result, players should not repeat the same the exact action for the same exact 
purpose, unless there was a relevant change in the conditions.
*<span style="color:grey"> If you are trying to jump a wall and you fail, you cannot 
repeat the jump in the same conditions, because the first check already determines that 
you are not skilled enough to do so under those circumstances. You may, 
however, try jumping again if you were to find a better place or use some supporting equipment, 
such as a wooden stool. </span>*. If and action could be 
repeated until a success occurs, then such an action should be 
considered an auto-success as it will have no impact in the narrative 
(the player would jump the wall eventually!). 

The lack of repetition forces the players to explain why the action 
is not possible as well as promoting thinking of other ways of overcoming 
the same obstacle. So failure is an opportunity to add complications, twists and 
new developments to the story that the players need to consider.

* *<span style="color:grey">  For simple challenges, the action may be interrupted instead of failing, preventing the action from being repeated (a guard shows up, the lock breaks, etc.) The action fails not because the character isn’t skilled enough to do it, but because something happened while he was attempting it. </span>  
* *<span style="color:grey">  if the challenge involves information, failure can result in partial recalling, confusing news, gathering rumors or even misleading or misinformation.</span>  
* *<span style="color:grey">  For more complex challenges, failure may instead result in a reduced effect instead of a full effect, for example, each value away from the success range, damage is reduced by 1. Likewise, less information can be discovered, deciphered or recovered from documents or investigations.</span>  
* *<span style="color:grey">  On the other hand, if the resulting effect is negative, the action could fails with a negative effect such as accumulation of frustration resistance counter.</span> <sub><sup>[(Back to start)](#)</sup></sub>  


#### Helping  

if multiple players try the same action simultaneously, 
one may receive help from the others when the situation 
logically allows it. In such cases, any actions from another 
character that can logically influence the outcome of a character’s action, 
may allow a +1 help bonus to be used to tip the scales in favor of success, 
effectively extending both character’s success range. 
*<span style="color:grey"> If the players are trying to pick a lock of a small 
and delicate box, it is possible for two characters to attempt the action, 
where one character tries to pick the lock while the other guides or supports 
the first character to complete its task by providing a +1 help. </span>*

Besides helping in a single action, it is possible for characters to help each other 
using different actions. On such cases, the help action needs to succeed to provide 
the help bonus.
*<span style="color:grey">One character tries to jump a wall and the other will 
provide a push with his hands</span>*. Within this case, it may also be possible 
for a character to help all other characters in their various actions simultaneously, 
instead of focusing on the action from a  single character. In such case, all other characters 
will gain the help bonus from one single action, however, the action will suffer from a 
-1 difficulty penalty. 
*<span style="color:grey">A character can try to distract or outmaneuver an adversary during combat, 
forcing it into a disadvantageous position and providing a +1 bonus to all actions from any other 
character against that adversary. </span>* <sub><sup>[(Back to start)](#)</sup></sub>  

#### Special Values  
Special values like 1 or 6 may be considered when defining the effects of some descriptors such as conditions and abilities (see below). In such cases, rolling a 1 can be seen as a bad outcome and rolling a 6 a good outcome. *<span style="color:grey"> For example, an ability effect dependent of rolling a 6, or additional fatigue damage taken when rolling a one, which allows for a more flexible and unpredictable ability generation. Likewise, a condition may worsen when a 1 is rolled or only be fully healed when a 6 is rolled.</span>*  </span>* <sub><sup>[(Back to start)](#)</sup></sub>   

### 3.2) Recovery  
Any descriptors having a counter can accumulate damage and so, may be allowed to recover. However, note that not all of these descriptors by recover naturally. *<span style="color:grey"> While minor scratches will heal with time, a damaged reputation may only the healable with actions</span>*. As such, the way these descriptors recover damage will vary with the nature of the descriptor, as recovering from mental stress is different than recovering from battle wounds. Most often than not, recovery is associated with either rest, healing in a safe and quiet place for some time, or a specific task, such as finding proof of a set up to recover one’s reputation.

One important consideration in relation to rest is that it must be a limited resource at player’s disposal. So, during each rest (or day), the players may be allowed to take only so many recovery actions. These actions may include:  
* Healing may be automatic. *<span style="color:grey"> Simply resting and enjoying a peaceful time for a while may allow the recovery of resistance such as stress, frustration or even dissipate magical energies. </span>*
* Healing may require the consumption of items. *<span style="color:grey"> One could recover fatigue resistance just by taking a break, but it could also be considered that food must be consumed to restore the body’s energy or potions may be used to recover physical wounds. </span>*
* Healing may require an action and thus a check by one character. In these cases, using skills with appropriate items and in the appropriate conditions upgrades the effect. *<span style="color:grey"> For example, battle damaged accumulated to the physical resistance may require a medicine-type skill check to heal. Doing so with disinfectant liquids and bandages will obtain better results than with improvised materials</span>* </span>* <sub><sup>[(Back to start)](#)</sup></sub>   

#### Wounds   
The limitation of rest actions is important because, if accumulated damage is not properly healed, it may become greater than the resistance level. If that happens, the character gains a related (minor) <span style="color:green"> wound</span> that provides constant penalty equal to its level. If the wound level is greater than the resistance tier, then the character is incapacitated and gains a (major) wound trait. However, gaining a wound immediately restore all accumulated damage and the resistance level becomes that of the tier equal to the current wound level. *<span style="color:grey"> For example, a dragon burns away the character’s tier 1 resistance with 7 damage. The character will gain a minor burned wound, imposing a constant -1 penalty to all actions 1 damage to the tier 2 resistance. </span>*Minor wounds require simple treatment that can be provided by anyone, but major wounds require trained medical treatment, access to adequate medical supplies and long resting as these are considerable handicaps, such as broken limbs, major confusion or memory loss.  </span>* <sub><sup>[(Back to start)](#)</sup></sub>   

#### Conditions  
Associated with damage and wounds, some special items, abilities or critical hits may cause specific effects. These temporary effects can be considered the <span style="color:green"> conditions </span>subgroup of descriptors (in which wounds may be included!). These descriptors are a varied group that diseases, magic effects, character conscious states, moving restriction or any other conditions that can be gained and lost easily. Because these descriptors are temporary, it is important to consider how they may be removed (naturally, with an action, consuming an appropriate item, through magic, etc.) On the other side, some of these descriptors may lead to long lasting or permanent effect if untreated for too long, to a worsening condition may be important. *<span style="color:grey"> A character is bitten by a snake, gaining the descriptor Poisoned(3:2) - you are under the effect of hallucinogenic poison and gain penalty to perception equal to the descriptor tier. A successful medical check decreases the level of the descriptor. If the level is reduced to 0, the tier is decrease by 1 and the level restarted at 3 until reduced to tier 0. Physical resistance checks are required every time a 1 is rolled and, if failed, the poison corrodes deeper gaining a level. If the descriptor reaches tier 4, the character is permanently affected, gaining the paranoids trait. </span>* <sub><sup>[(Back to start)](#)</sup></sub>   


### 3.3) Improvement  
In addition to representing actions that can fail, descriptors having a level characteristic also represent action that can be improved. This means that, besides having an associated success range and action resolution mechanism, they must also have a levelling mechanism. 

In the 5+ system, characters do not level up or gain power at certain points in a deterministic way. They age and gain experience, meaning that they must use descriptors (such as skills) to improve through trial and error. As such, each time a descriptor is used, there is a small change that the character notices or learns something useful, improving his chances from then on. 

When using and action and rolling 2d6 as part of the action resolution, if the same number is rolled on both dice (double) then the character notices something interesting, regardless of success or failure. If the double is at least the current descriptor level plus tier value, the character learns from the action, immediately improving it by gaining a level to the descriptor checked. Otherwise, you may mark the skill to know your character found something interesting about it. *<span style="color:grey">A character attempts to block the enemy’s attack with a shield using the shield(3/2) descriptor. The player rolls a double 5, which is at least the value of level (3) + tier (2), meaning that the descriptor levels up to shield(4/2) even if the action failed. On the other hand, if a double 4 has been rolled, the descriptor would have not improved, but the descriptor would have been marked as shield(3/2)\* for later reference </span>*

During each resting time, the player may choose to take time to practice some descriptors. If so, then for each practice the player chooses two marked descriptors and removed the marking in order to attempt a free level up 2d6 roll for one of them as focusing the practice on one skill requires another to be left aside. * <span style="color:grey">Note that, even though the default level up system is random, players may decide to provide buy points after certain milestones to reward their characters in more direct ways.</span>*
</span>* <sub><sup>[(Back to start)](#)</sup></sub>   

#### Abilities  
As the characters improve their descriptors and become more proficient at certain actions, they may also learn new ways of doing these actions, being that new methods, more powerful techniques and simply learning how to use more advanced tools. These technical improvements are reflected by the descriptor tier value, which groups levels of proficiency and is mostly important to accommodate for long running games. If a character levels up a descriptor with a double 6, it also unlocks a new tier. *<span style="color:grey">This means that you can have a descriptor Fire magic (5:1+2) – you can cast fire spells, representing that you’re current skill is at level 5 of tier 1, but you have started experimenting with more complex magic and may use the skill at level 2 of the tier above, that is, tier 2. </span>* However, characters can only have one base tier not fully leveled up, so if a second double 6 is rolled, will level up the tier above again. Only once the base tier is fully levelled up, will the base tier change. *<span style="color:grey">If the descriptor Fire magic (5:1+2) was used and a double 6 is rolled, then the descriptor will progress to Fire magic (3:2) instead of  Fire magic (6:1+1). This is because rolling a double value of at least 6+1 is not possible, to the descriptor is at maximum level and the base tier improves. </span>*

Consistent with the increase of power, mastery of a new technique or even just the development of a new approach, unlocking higher tiers of a skill may optionally unlock abilities. Abilities are special actions that the character can use by pushing itself a bit further to impose additional effects on their target.  *<span style="color:grey">For example, if the sword skill (3:1) levels up with a double 6, it will unlock the next tier, sword (4:1+1), and the character may also learnt he tier 2 sword-related technique such as Quick-Draw (2): you may use your sword while still sheathed gaining a surprise attack with bonus. Abilities are general effects and can be used for any descriptor that has a level characteristic, such as adding a fear condition with a successful intimidation attempt, being able to find extra clues in an investigation or easily noticing ambushes</span>*. Because abilities represent an additional effort than the underlying regular action, theses descriptors have a cost such as fatigue resistance damage, limiting the amount of times these actions can be used. *<span style="color:grey">One default ability to consider is raising the action stakes. This ability allows the characters to push their limits and attempt to improve the result of their action. For the cost of 1 fatigue damage, the dice can be re-rolled to either revert a failure or strengthen a success, allowing for both critical hits and critical fumbles to occur at key moments of the adventure.</span>* </span>* <sub><sup>[(Back to start)](#)</sup></sub>   

#### Items  
Besides improving the character's own proficiency and power by increasing descriptors’, characters may also have improve by acquiring more powerful <span style="color:green">equipment</span>. Equipment can be considered as a sub-group of descriptors, describing those effect associated with a particular item. As such, equipment is free form and can be defined on the fly. In this way, equipment is a very flexible way to promote character progression as it can be used to influence any of the character’s own descriptors.  *<span style="color:grey">Depending on the game, these descriptors may have all characteristics, where the level reflects the item’s durability, the damage the damage accumulated during usage, the tier the minimum proficiency required to use the item effectively </spam>*. Because equipment is free-form, the number of possible effects combinations makes its used almost unlimited. However, there are a number of basic options that can be considered:

* Items can restrict access to certain descriptors (skills or abilities): *<span style="color:grey">A common case would be that of weapons, where a character isn’t be able to use the axe descriptor without a having an axe equipped. A more extreme example could be to limit spellcasting to the consumption of casting ingredients or possession of focus items, where a caster may simply not be able to cast a spell without "water item" equipped (or a spell book). </span>*

* Items of higher or lower quality (or items that are blessed or cursed), may provide bonus or penalties to a descriptor or action: *<span style="color:grey"> A well-crafted wooden spear may still be too weak to cause meaningful damage a thick scaled dragon the same way that a potion of strength will add a bonus to all strength related tasks </span>*

* Items may be used to protect the characters: *<span style="color:grey"> Particularly true for armor and magical items, these items can either reduce or prevent certain types of damage (physical, mental, magical, etc.) A leather plate armor may provide a simple damage reduction by 1 for a successful  physical resistance check, while a full plate armor may increase physical resistance by 2, add a -1 weight penalty to action requiring dexterity, reduce damage by 3 on successful resistance and body movement and prevent damage from light weapons completely. On the other hand, a magical amulet may provide immunity to fire damage twice before re-charging or a wind armor reduce ranged damage taken by 1. </span>*

* Magical or other specific items allow for more general powers or effects to be imbued in the equipment: *<span style="color:grey"> Something as mundane as a poisoned dagger can unlock a poison ability, which can be called 3 times to induce poison on a target or a warhammer having the stun effect when a 6 is rolled. More exotic effect can be considered such as a scroll of thunder having a thunder spell descriptor that can be called to use the thunder spell at the specified level or a mantle of rose scent allowing automatic success convincing blind creatures the character is a talking rose. </span>* </span>* <sub><sup>[(Back to start)](#)</sup></sub>   

## 4) Challenges
### 4.1 Structure  
The game is structured as a sequence of actions the players have their characters attempting. This way, each player needs to constantly answer the question *“What now?”* To determine the actions their character will take. A <span style="color:green">turn</span> is a round of player’s actions, where the player narrates the character’s actions. In this way, turns work as a way to give all players equal opportunity to act, including skipping the turn. However, there is no intrinsic order within a turn, with all actions on the same turn being considered as simultaneously as possible. This means that the order the players act doesn’t have to match the actual order of character actions, being perfectly possible to a player to act after a player and decide to have the character act before the other player’s character. 

A turn starts with a <span style="color:green">description of the situation</span> and a quick definition of what each NPC will be doing in the next instants after which each <span style="color:green">player describes the actions</span>  the character will do. Actions are free-form and if the player comes up with an idea, that should be implemented within reason. If an action requires a non-existent descriptor, it can easily be created on the fly, by considering character's concept and determine a reasonable proficiency. Once the actions of all involved parties are determined, <span style="color:green">all actions with uncertain results must be resolved</span>  by comparing the sum of a 2d6 and the appropriate success range, including those check requested as consequence of non-player characters’ (NPCs) actions.  Once the actions are resolved, check for double rolls and descriptor improvements. </span>* <sub><sup>[(Back to start)](#)</sup></sub>   

### 4.2) Objectives  
Each action attempted by a character is potential a challenge. Some of the actions described can just be role-played either because there are simple enough to always succeed or because they are impossible to the point of always failing. *<span style="color:grey">Let us take the action of walking as an example. If a character wakes up and tries to walk out of the room, there is no need to question the action’s results. Later on, if the same character tries to cross a river by walking over the water, the intended result is impossible because it will sink into the river. </span>* However, if the outcome of the action is uncertain, either because the character is being actively opposed by someone or something or because it is attempting a difficult non-routine action, a <span style="color:green">challenge</span>  situation may arise. Each challenge has an objective or a list of goals that need to be achieved before it can be overcome. 

Challenges are defined by the winning and losing conditions as well as the opposition. The <span style="color:green">winning condition</span> is the total amount of successes the players need to collectively accumulate to overcome the challenge. For simple tasks, the winning condition is simply succeeding a descriptor check (or accumulation 1 success). However, more complex challenges, such as investigations, elections or even maybe disarming a particularly complex trap, will require more accumulated successes to be overcome. *<span style="color:grey">If the characters are challenged with a crime scene they must investigate, the clues they find depend on the number of successes they obtain, where each clue is a challenge goal. Similarly, in a combat, each enemy will be a goal that is defeated once a number of successes has been obtained. </span>* Even though nothing prevents these challenges from being solved with a single roll, playing through them slowly may focus the game on a particularly intense challenge. This will attenuate the effect of randomness in the outcome by diluting the impact of any single roll or increase the difficulty of one task but provide more cinematic scenes by adding twists and turns until the final outcome. *<span style="color:grey"> The number of success required to win a challenge should depend on the desired difficulty of the challenge and the player’s key descriptor levels. As such, defining a default challenge could help set up and fine tune later challenges. The default challenge could be as simple as the sum of the key descriptors levels of all players, which would scale with the increasing character’s proficiency. In a combat challenge, the key descriptors would be the most used weapon descriptors, which determine how often the players will succeed. </span>*


If the players are not allowed to fail the challenge, then they will continue to accumulate successes until eventually enough successes are accumulated (see failure handling [above](#failure-handling)). To keep the challenge real, <span style="color:green">losing conditions</span> may be considered for each challenge. A common loosing condition is damage accumulation to one resistance, where character become incapable of continuing their efforts. *<span style="color:grey"> The most common example would be damage accumulated to physical resistance during a fight, where a character can only take so much damage before collapsing unconscious or taking so many wounds before dying. However, each specific challenge type may be assigned a resistance descriptor effectively making this a general way to impose losing conditions. For example, failing to decipher an ancient script can damage frustration resistance, reflecting the character’s increases agitation and loss of focus due to the growing frustration. </span> There are potentially as many losing conditions as challenges, since each challenge may be lost differently. Common losing conditions to include: 

* Time sensitive challenges: the players have only so many turns to overcome the challenge. *<span style="color:grey">The characters need to convince the commander of a enemy force to join your cause before the main force arrives if you’re to stand a chance opposing it </span>*
* Failure tolerance: the player can fail only so many times. *<span style="color:grey">A character is trying to disable a complex explosive trap and with each failure there is a change of it exploding </span>*
* Arm-wresting: The characters are opposed by someone in a back and forth challenge and need to avoid hitting the point of no return. *<span style="color:grey"> The characters need to convince the town’s population they are not infiltrated spies but have to struggle with whoever is spreading rumors against them before a critical mass of the population turns against them.  </span>* </span>* <sub><sup>[(Back to start)](#)</sup></sub>   

#### Successes (“damage”)
The number of accumulated successes for any action is defined by the same 2d6 roll used to determine if the action succeeds. The default number of successes obtain is the lowest value rolled. This value may be ignored (immunity), downgraded to 1 (resistance), or upgraded to the highest value rolled (weakness). However, descriptors can provide modifiers and change the number of successes a character obtains for any given action. *<span style="color:grey">A character with an Attentive trait may obtain +1 successes when investigating, a character with a high quality axe equipped may deal twice the damage when rolling a 6 or new ability allows the character to split the successes of a logical argumentation to between two targets. </span>*  </span>* <sub><sup>[(Back to start)](#)</sup></sub>   


#### NPCs
Besides the winning and losing conditions, challenges may have a clear <span style="color:green"> opposition </span> force. This can be as simple as a rolling boulder in a narrow corridor and as complex as a multi-regional organization. However, relevant opposition will add additional option to the challenge, contribution with bonuses, abilities and special effects than will make the challenge more difficult than otherwise. Often this opposition is in the form of an NPC or a group of NPCs (organization), which will have some signature ability or behavior. It is important to remember that, because the player’s roll define success on its own, NPCs do not roll. If a player succeeds in an opposed challenge, it’s because the opposition failed, which mean that NPC do not need to have a character sheet and are, like items, defined by a few descriptors: 

* Goals: Why is the NPC opposing the players? *<span style="color:grey">Is it a giant hungry spider trying to eat the players, an demonic spirit hopping to corrupt them or simply a vengeful adventure trying to get payback </span>

* Its actions and abilities: What actions the NPC attempt to do and what special abilities can it use? *<span style="color:grey">Can the NPC bite, smash or summon inter-dimensional demon of ultimate destruction? Or maybe it will simply insult and provoke the players? </span>* Calling on an NPC's ability may be done at will to provide diversity to the conflict. However, some powerful abilities may depend on the player’s luck and be used as part of a critical fumble or when a 1 is rolled.

* Its encounter behavior: How does the NPC reacts to player’s successes and failures? *<span style="color:grey">Does the NPC can act more fearful as the players accumulate successes or more boldly as the players fail? Does it call for help after so many turns? Will it run if the situation turns sour? </span>*

* Its difficulty: How hard will the NPC be to defeat? This is defined by both the NPC challenge rank and the number of success required to accumulate to win. Modifying the number of successes based on a default challenge is an easy way to fine tune an NPC difficulty, while changing the NPC rank will have a clearer impact on difficulty, influencing both the chances and amounts of success. *<span style="color:grey"> In order to simplify NPC generation, their damage is constant by default, being equal to 1 + rank. The 1 represents the baseline damage which may easily be increases to accompany the players resistances’ tier progression. </span>* </span>* <sub><sup>[(Back to start)](#)</sup></sub>   

###  4.3) Actions  
In their turns, the players will act. These actions could be a violent attack with a sword, a desperate defense by raising a shield, a quick check around to find something out of place or even just hiding for someone. Most actions may fail, so they will be tied with descriptors with level (such as skills).  Within a turn, there will be three may types of actions a player can take: <span style="color:green">active actions</span> by the character, <span style="color:green">passive actions</span>  and <span style="color:green">resisting actions</span>  as a result of NPC actions. *<span style="color:grey">A player decides to have the character jump over a broken bridge to escape its pursuers who in turn threw a spear at the character hoping to prevent it’s escape. The player will roll both for the active action of jumping and the passive action of dodging the spear</span>* Since all actions in a turn occurs as simultaneously as possible, players will get a -1 <span style="color:green">rush penalty</span> for each additional action taken (to all actions!), reflecting a less precise but faster action. On the other hand, if the player focuses on a single action, the character would get a +1 <span style="color:green">focus bonus</span> due to the additional care put in such an action. As such, it can be thought that all character start with a +2 bonus every turn and will add a -1 penalty for each action they take *to all 2d6 rolled*. Of note, it is important to notice that player may decide to fail a passive check and that resistance actions are instantaneous and instinctive, so they do not count as a rushed action *<span style="color:grey">Landing safely on the other side of the bridge, the character see an enemy wizard approaching and readying a spell. The player decides to attempt a ranged attack to shoot the wizard before it can fly over the broken bridge. To increase the chances, the player decides to focus on its active attack action, ignoring the passive defense action and accepting it is going to be hit by whatever magic the wizard casts. This spell turns out to be a demoralizing spell, aiming to make the player surrender so a resistance action is required. Even though the player will roll 2d6 twice, only one of these action counts for the rush penalty so the character still gains a +1 bonus to the attack</span>*. Action will mostly fall within the following groups:

* Attack: Active action to damage a target in any way (physically, mentally, socially, etc). *<span style="color:grey">These would include using weapons, intimidation or insulting a target, spreading rumors or lies or even develop a logical accusation, etc. as long as the result would plausibly damage a descriptor</span>*.
* Defend: A Passive action used in to prevent damage in response or another character’s action. *<span style="color:grey">These would include dodging a trap, using armor or shields, rebutting an accusation, protecting social status during a scandal, etc. as long as it could plausibly prevent damage to a descriptor</span>*.
* Abilities: Abilities are particular actions that not all character have access to. Even though this may not be relevant for all games, most of the abilities will be restricted costing damage to a specific descriptor, *<span style="color:grey">for example casting spells may deal damage to mind resistance descriptor due to the exhausting nature of magic </span>*, they may require constant concentration checks to maintain, *<span style="color:grey">a bard would need to keep passing performance actions to maintain its inspiring song  </span>*, or they may have specific activation conditions, *<span style="color:grey">such as rolling a 6 on a related action such as using dual strike with a staff</span>*.
* Maneuvers: Active actions that result in bonuses or penalties due to outmaneuvering, distracting or discrediting the target. *<span style="color:grey">These actions could include action or trick that imposes a disadvantage (disarm, restrain, throw sand), provides a bonus (hide, use terrain advantage, aim, engage) or impose a condition (stunned, prone, confused) to a character</span>*. Given that some of these maneuvers may be considered powerful actions in some settings or games, it is possible to associate them with abilities, critical hits or even only triggering as free action when a 6 is rolled (or a one is rolled against the player).
* Move: In this system, there are no grids, maps or any other sort of objective locations and positions during conflicts. The general layout is described, highlighting particularities that could be used for or against the players. All characters will start in relative positions to the players so tracking space is simplified by defining three regions in relation to the players: near, far and away. Melee and short-range actions can only target in the near area, which ranged actions can have targets in the far area. Only in very particular cases may someone target a character in the away area, as this represents an area outside the conflict zone.

It is assumed that the character are always moving about their area so moving is only required to remove conditions (stand up, clear head), interact with particular items or other characters (reload a weapon, drag a wounded ally, push through) or approach targets in different areas. To move from one zone to another, an unblocked path (may interactions) and full movement (-2 move penalty to all actions) is required. </span>* <sub><sup>[(Back to start)](#)</sup></sub>   

## 5) Game Master options 
Even though this system may be used without defining a Game Master that drives the story, it is important to keep in mind that ways to solve potential conflicts between players’ actions need to be defined. This can be by keeping player as referee or maybe switching this task between players by having rotation narrators, but it can be also done by quickly voting to achieve a consensual agreement, depending on the group dynamics. Regardless of the way the ultimate decisions are made, it is important to give the players multiple opportunities to contribute to the story. The common way to do so is by having the players interact with the world through their characters, but other options should be considered. Take for example:
* Allow the players to interpreting the results of their own actions, taking these interpretations as suggestions to what could happen at the end of the turn.
* Allow players to add details to the scene, place or situation by suggesting what their character notices. This way, all players have the opportunity to contribute to the scene, from simply adding new descriptive details and bringing out different things about the places they visit. This doesn’t need to be a major addition with plot ramifications, just a small decorative feature, a curious situation or filling up the room with a character could bring the scene to life.
* When gathering information in towns, taverns or any other suitable place, allow the players to add their own rumors, hints and clues. These may be interesting twists to the story, suggestion  of side quests to take or simple adding background history to make the city feel more real.

Besides the generally allowing all players to contribute, the “single-player option” can be used to actually remove the need for a game master. This option uses only a regular deck of cards, from which each player draws a hand of cards. The number of cards drawn depends on how the game is run, but 3 or 4 would give each player a good starting choice. The player with the lowest value card may play it, starting a scene and defining the next challenge. Once that challenge is complete, all players may play another card with a face value above the one on the table (note that, even though face values may differ from region to region, as long as all players involved agree on how to use the cards, this should not be a problem). Once no player can play more cards, the scene ends. Note that, using royals as important NPC encounters (maybe boss encounters!), aces special local events and joker far reaching, world changing events, the intensity of the scene is forced to increases as higher valued cards build up to an important challenge. On the other hand, the suits on the card determine the type of challenge the players are facing at the beginning, regardless of how it turns out in the end!):
* Hearts are for socializers: Include a relevant amount of interaction with NPCs (chatty enemies, distressed peasants, negotiating passage).
* Diamonds are for achievers: Include or point to some clear reward or something the players can achieve or collect (rare equipment sets, money, status).
* Spades are for explorers: Introduce new lands, explain long lost secrets or clarify some historical event or any other discovery (background information, a rumors of distant lands, a secret revealed by an solving a puzzle).
* Clubs are for killers: Should be filled with combat and fights (challenges of power, all out combat, arenas)


Once a card is played, the challenge is introduced by the player that used the card, who is free add lore, locations and characters to the game, or even use previously mentioned characters or location and integrate them into their own scenes. </span>* <sub><sup>[(Back to start)](#)</sup></sub>
