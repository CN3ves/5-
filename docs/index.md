Welcome to my little page for a PbP system developing and testing :)
This system aims to be a simple and general way to play any type of RPG, with a particular focus on play-by-post (PbP) gaming. As such, the idea is to provide simplified rules that allow to keep the game flowing at a good narrative pace. This is a free-form, 2d6 skill-based system, so it allows anything to be used or done with the same dice roll, as long as it is reasonable within the game's setting. The way it works is:  
  
  1. The scene is introduced and the players describe *their intentions*.
  2. Each player *call for an action or an effect*.
  3. Every action is resolved by rolling two six-sided dice (2d6) and sum up the values.
  4. The actions of all intervening characters, both playable (PC) and non-playable (NPC) are described based on the results.
