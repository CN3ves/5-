Welcome to my little page for developing and testing the 5+ success range system. This system aims to be a simple and general way to play any type of RPG, with a particular focus on play-by-post (PbP) gaming. The idea is to provide simplified and minimal rules that allow to keep the game flowing at a good narrative pace, while guaranteeing logical character development. This is a free-form, 2d6 skill-based system, and should be flexible and adaptable enough to allow any idea and material from any other source to be used.

## 1. Character

### 1.1 Descriptors
*[top]()*

**Descriptors are small, clear sentences that define the character**, how it differs from all other people in the world and what its current status is. As such, anything that can said about the character is a descriptor. Descriptors are free-form and limited only by the setting, the player's imagination and a hint of good sense. Descriptors can be understood more easily by dividing them into meaningful groups:  
  
  * **The only descriptor required at the start of the game is the concept**. The concept is a short description that summarises the character. The concept is the default descriptor that ties all other descriptors, defining what is allowed for each character.  
  > *For example, you can consider the common race/class/specialization as a starting point (Elf, Wizard, Illusion) and add adjectives and a background (Educated, Charming, Noble) to create the concept of Educated and Charming Elven Noble Illusionist*.
  
  * **Traits** reflect any permanent characteristic of the character and can be both positive and negative. Examples of traits would include inheritable racial features, particular cultural or professional skills and any noticeable physical or personality features. The traits must be derived from the concept and can be created on the fly by calling on the concept: if it fits the concept, then it can be added to the character. Based on their character concept, players should consider how they want to play their character and what traits it should have, ideally starting with at least two more positive traits and one more negative trait. 
  > Continuing from the previous example, elven racial traits could be magical attunement and nimble, from a culture that promotes arts and craft, being a wizard it would have a professional trait of spell-casting, alchemy and arcane understanding, physically beautiful but with a burned scar covering most of his body from a alchemical accident and the character's personality would be well mannered and charming, but slightly arrogant and impatient.  
<details><summary><i>More trait examples</i></summary>
  <i>The following examples are simple trait descriptors. Players should try to elaborate further their own descriptors, particularly how and when they can be an advantage or a disadvantage. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Racial:</u> Tough, Magic resistance, Flexible, Nimble, Fire Breath, Poison resistance, Shape-shifter, Clockwork, Mind-reader, etc. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Cultural:</u> Stone cutting, Magic training, Warmongering, Loyalty, Merchant, Spacefarer, etc. <br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Personality:</u> Easy going, Aggressive, Well mannered, Vengeful, Stoic, Naysayer, Submissive, etc.</i>
  <br>&nbsp;
</details>  
  
  * **Skills** are the general adventuring actions a character may attempt to do. Skills include anything that is not a character specific action. As such, skills correspond every possible action that can fail and be improved, from using weapons and armour to interacting with other creatures and objects. To define the character skills, think what sort of actions the characters will be doing during the adventure. Similarly to traits, skills can be created on the fly, but some more advanced or specialised skills may be forbidden for some characters, if previous training cannot be justified by the character's concept. For a simple selection of skills at character creation, refer to the skills examples below.  
  > *For an illusionist, relevant skills could be, invisibility, create sound, create image, distract and fast talk. However, the character has no formal combat training and cannot use weapons and armour effectively.*.

### 1.2 Progression
*[top]()*  

In this system, characters do not level up or gain quanta of power at certain points in a deterministic way. They age and gain experience! Characters can progress (or improve) in 3 different ways: gain experience with skills, acquire better equipment and learn new abilities. 

**Skills** level up using a “learn by doing” system. Every time a skill descriptor is called and a double is rolled that is, both dice show the same value, if that value is above the skill level, it gains a new level. If the value is not above the skill level, 1 experience point (XP) is gained. 
  
Accumulated XP can be used to further develop the character in more general ways. XP represent the general learning accumulated during the adventure, thus it can be used to "buy" both skills and abilities:  
  
  * The number of XP required to buy a new skill or ability level equals twice the level being bough. 
>*Level 3 skill requires 8 XP to level up*
  * The number of XP required to buy a new ability equals thrice the number of abilities already known by the character. 
> *A character with 4 abilities will buy a fifth with 12XP.*  
  * Buying a skill that the character is untrained (that is, buying training), requires 5XP per training descriptor that the character already has in addition to the actual *in character* training expenses. Training allows the level 0 skill to be used.

As skills, **equipment** is free-form and can be defined on the fly. To quickly create a new piece of equipment or an item, simply name it by defining it and adding an adjective to the base name.To that, a small extra descriptor may be added if the equipment has any distinctive feature or power. Of course, legendary items can have names that are a reference to some historical or mythical place, event or person, and can be uses as opportunities for flashback chapters or as part of character arcs.  
> *For example, Rusting Sword, Long Rope, Long-ranged Rifle. 
For a distinctive power, compare useless potion with useless potion of might.
Instead of the general legendary holy sword of divine power, it may be better to call it *.  


Because equipment is free-form, its uses are limited only by the players imagination. Consider the following 4 common way of using equipment:  
  
  * The item applies a bonus to a skill: Equipment that provides bonus will be noted as +1/X (the casual penalty as -1/X), where +1 is the provided bonus (-1 the penalty) and X the maximum level obtainable with equipment.
> A Cheap Stick is +1/1, meaning that players get a +1 bonus on their stick (spear/staff?) skill as long as this bonus does not result in a modifier greater than of 1, so the equipment has no effect for players with "stick" skill at level 1. Likewise, a Balanced Sword could be +1/3, which provides a bonus for players below sword level 3. This means that you may be too skilful to actually gain any bonus from your equipment.  
  * The item has a descriptor which can be called: This allows for more general powers or effects to be imbued in the equipment and allows for more flexibility in equipment creation.  
> A poisoned dagger has poison descriptor, which can be called 3 times to induce poison on a target.  
A scroll of thunder has a thunder spell descriptor that can be called to use the thunder spell at the specified level.  
A warhammer has the stun effect, which can be called to hit harder when out-manoeuvring an enemy.  
A mantle of rose scent may let you automatically convince blind creatures you're a talking rose  
  * The item may be used to protect the characters: Particularly true for armour and magical items, these items can either reduce or prevent certain types of damage, physical or mental wounds  
> A leather plate armour may absorb the first 3 wounds while fully repaired, while a full plate armour may reduce damage from light weapons.  
A magical amulet may provide immunity to fire damage twice before re-charging.  
  * The item may provide access to certain skills: This will be mostly true for weapons and armour skills, as a character won't be able to use a the axe skill without an axe, but it may also be relevant for spell-casting in some settings.  
> The most extreme example would be that of a level 3 water magic caster that is not be able to cast any water spells if her create water ring is not equipped. This would work as a specialization of the spell book concept, where each spell is associated with an item and cannot be cast if the item is not active.

## 2. Conflict

### 2.1 Structure
*[top]()*  

The game is started by the Game Master (GM), which is the player that defines the overall setting and game story. However, besides this main story, each character has an individual motivation, a goal or a story to explore. To accommodate this, **the system is organized into scenes**, where each player may own any given scene. A scene is a self-contained part of a story, such as a mission or a dungeon, that the characters decided to pursue. So, even though only one player takes the role of GM at any time, the other players have the opportunity to contribute to the scene with more than their character actions, for example:
  
  > Since the skill check result can be immediately interpreted, the player performing the action is allowed to interpret the result of his own action. The next player can then add any interesting details that may introduce his own actions. As such, two players can interpret any single skill check, including adding any required details. Once all players have acted, the scene owner then reinterprets the entire turn taking into account the players suggestions.
  
  > After a new scene, place or situation is introduced, the players should add a detail to the scene by suggesting some detail their character notices. This way, all players have the opportunity to contribute to the scene, from simply adding new descriptive details and bringing out different things about the places they visit, from adding a character or hinting on something that could be happening soon.
  
To **take over the scene** a player must first build up enough information for the other players to follow one of their quests. At the beginning of the game, each player picks 3 cards. Each player will then be able to add rumours, hints and clues to the story, passively gathered from reasonable "information" sources. These small pieces of information are used to drive other players into their secret story arc. Once other players take the "bait" and decide to follow these tips, the player can play one card, starting a his own scene. Whenever a new player takes over, the previous scene owner picks 3 new cards. 
  
  > **Card suits**: The suit of the card played to take over the scene reflects the type of quest or game-play to use:  
  *Hearts are for socializers*: Include a relevant amount of interaction with NPCs (chatty enemies, distressed peasants, negotiating passage).  
  *Diamonds are for achievers*: Include or point to some clear reward or something the players can achieve or collect (rare equipment sets, money, status).  
  *Spades are for explorers*, Introduce new lands, explain long lost secrets or clarify some historical event or any other discovery (background information, a rumours of distant lands, a secret revealed by an solving a puzzle).  
  *Clubs are for killers*: Should be filled with combat and fights (challenges of power, all out combat, arenas)  
  
  > **Card values**: Two of the cards in the player's hand can be discarded to provide the scene owner with rumours at any suitable time, up to the numeric value of the card. The scene owner is then responsible for making sure the rumours get to the character's hears. Royals will represent important named enemies (possibly recurring enemies) will appear, instead of rumours, while Aces represent a new friendly or helpful connection. A Joker is an important event with far reaching implication that may change the current status quo.

___


Each scene is structured using turns, where **each turn is made by a single intervention from every player**. The turn structure is used in all situations, to give the opportunity for every player to take an action. At the beginning of each turn, the previous actions are resolved, the consequences described and the new situation introduced. Each players then explains how the character will respond to the new situation, with a new turn starting once all character have an intended action. Importantly, **all actions within a turn occurs simultaneously** so there is no clear initiative or turn order. As such, all actions will be resolved in the order the scene owner finds most appropriate. 

**Conflict arises any time the outcome of a players' actions is uncertain** so the result of these actions must be determined before continuing. All conflicts are solved with a 2d6 roll which informs the narrative and the behaviour of the NPCs on the next turn. It is the balance between successful and failed actions that will determine how the overall encounter proceeds. *This is to say that, for example, a dragon does not have to be bashed to a pulp of negative HP to be defeated. Its actions are determined by the number of successes and failures the players accumulated during the conflict, where a certain number of successes (or failures) reflect a new action, approach or consideration by the dragon.*
