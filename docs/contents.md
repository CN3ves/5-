**1) Character creation**

**1.1) Character creation: Concept**
> Concept: Define your character using two or three descriptive words. This concept can be as simple as the common race/class/specialization combination 

**1.2) Character creation: Abilities**
> Racial ability: Suggest a race for your character. Any race is valid so you can play classic races, modification of these (twisted elves, gracious dwarves) or something totally new (energetic half-koalas, sentient chairs). Think what would be the most striking characteristic of your race. (As a sentient chair, you can easily hide among other furniture of similar taste, so the racial ability Hide in the Furniture would be suitable). You can add one more positive racial trait by also taking one negative racial to balance. 

> Cultural ability: Suggest a culture's, profession's or group's ability that your character acquired due to his upbringing and experience. Note that this could be a cross-race or cross-borders trait shared by many members of a region or vocation. Let's say a player wants to play a noble crusader. Nobles are all posh bastards exploiting our good proletarian comrades regardless of their origin and crusaders are all the same throughout the realms, because they have a unifying set of beliefs. A possible cultural trait related to the professional training and social class could be Knight in Shining Armour: you polish your armour so well and so often that the light reflected on it is too bright for most mortal eyes to handle. Just as for the racial ability you can add one more positive cultural trait by also taking one negative trait to balance.

> Personal ability: If the racial ability is acquired from nature and cultural ability comes from nurture, then the personal ability is the result of experience. Your personal ability is that one thing you learned due to your unique experiences. Maybe it is something from your culture, profession or training that you mastered particularly well, or maybe it is something you acquired through practicing a hobby or exploring and studying alternative methods Did you hit your head when you were a child and gained telepathic powers? Maybe you have been chosen by a greater deity and you have some holy power. Did you learn or develop a new technique as a royal guard? Maybe you learned from your great-cousin how to trick old ladies to get their fortune? Once again, you can add one more personal ability, but the second one will require a potential setback. 

> Frustration: Adventuring is a difficult, stressful and frustrating activity. How will you react under stress, when the difficulties of the adventure are too much and you can't handle the frustration of the constant struggling? This trait will determine how the character reacts when mentally overwhelmed by the stress of the adventure.
