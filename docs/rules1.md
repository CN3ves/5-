First instruction of the module:
[ooc]Letâ€™s begin by having each player introduce their character to the group. Tell us the name you came up with for your character, your race, your class, your background, and an interesting fact about your character that you made up.[/ooc]

[spoiler="Character creation"]
The idea for THE SYSTEM is to emphasize the character concept and background but, because this is a very basic playtest adventure, just don't waste too much time with it... You basically wanted to be learn from The Master, because she is cool, and then you did :)
THE SYSTEM being tested is race- and class-free, so you can pick anything. You are allowed to suggest [b]one racial/cultural benefit[/b] (or more for collective brainstorming, but only keep one). My working example is [i]As a were-chicken, I have the chicken-out ability, which allows me to step out of dangerous situations.[/i] Don't worry about the mechanistic implementations of it for now (I'll just make sure your character dies a slow, painful dead it I can't implement it ðŸ˜ˆ)

[linebreak]

Because the idea is to simplify, I consider attributes such as STR and CON or INT and WIS to be redundant (they are basically physical and mental training). In addition, these attributes are only useful to define the skills or rolls (so mostly used for derivative stats and not actual game-playing). 
I could get rid of them but, because there are 3 main RPG types, styles or actions or whatever they are called, THE SYSTEM reflects those character tendencies. [b]The attributes are:[/b] 
* Fighting (or Combat?): bonus while in a combat (casting*, defending, attacking)
* Socializing (or Empathy?): bonus while interacting with any other sentient creature (persuade, barter, pet a dog) 
* Exploring (or Attention?): bonus in any exploration scene (tracking, orientation, search pile of papers). 
* Magic (optional): generally here to prevent non-magic users from using magic

Attribute values are -1,0 or 1, basically reflecting an acquired tendency for something.[b] All attributes start at 0, except magic that starts at -1.[/b] You are allowed to [b]change any attribute to 1 by setting another to -1[/b]. [i]The idea is that you spend more time than the common mortal training for combat (Fighting +1) so you didn't have time to learn the niceties of social interaction (Socializing -1) for example.[/i] 

* Casting is here because magic is optional... I'll have to sort this inconsistency ;)
[linebreak]
That should be simple enough. Skills is a bit more trick, because I want to try having them as [b]a free and fluid skills list[/b], allowing skills to be made up on the fly: [i]Has I look stunned at the strange alien spaceship, I just feel the need to ride it! I have no skill I can relate to alien technology so I add [u]space-faring skill[/u] to the list[/i]. The only way to do this is to have no fixed list of skills (eventually there could be some recommended skills)

Skills reflect anything you can do (including using weapons, casting spells, jumping on one foot, eating burgers contests). Generally, all skills start at level 0 and then the player needs to come up with background excuses to suggest relevant skills and level them up. However, the probabilities of success are really low for low skill levels, so we'll try it with you[b] picking 5 skills at level 4[/b] (65% success rate expected). Remember that these skills [b]include attacking with specific weapons and defending or dodging and any type of magic skills.[/b] Keep them as general or specific as you want and we'll start from there.
[i](how specific skills need to be depends on how easy it is to level them up in long campaigns so not really appropriate here)[/i]

One way of doing it is to pick something you're familier with (D&D for example) and thing how to fit it with this rules. This is obviously a group exercise so feel free to just mention a race/class :)
[/spoiler]

[b]Summary:[/b] Pick a race, set attributes and make up your skills. You can, and probably should, be inspired by other systems :D
